CHAPTER 

11.1 MEANING OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE

All countries have their own currencies, which are readily acceptable within their respective territories. For example, Indian Rupee ( $\boldsymbol{\ell}$ ) in India, US Dollar ( $\$$ ) in America, Pound ( $£$ ) in England, etc.
However, currency of one country is generally not accepted in another country. In case of an international payment, currency of one country has to be converted into the currency of another country because every country wants the payment in its own currency.

Foreign Exchange

Foreign Exchange refers to all currencies other than the domestic currency of a given country. For example, India's domestic currency is Indian Rupee and all other currencies like US Dollar, British Pound, Kuwaiti Dinar, etc., are foreign exchange.

For example, if an American firm exports goods to India, it would like to receive the payment in Dollars. As a result, Indian importers will have to convert Indian Rupees into American Dollars to make the payment.
It creates the problem of converting one currency into another and fixing the rate at which the two currencies are to be exchanged. In fact, it is the problem of determination of foreign exchange rate. Foreign Exchange Rate refers to the rate at which one currency is exchanged for the other. It represents the price of one currency in terms of another currency.

For example: If $\$ 1$ can be exchanged for $\mathbb{Z} 81$, then the value of $\mathbb{Z} 1$ will be:

$$
\mathfrak{2} 1=\frac{1}{81} \$=.0123 \$
$$

Foreign Exchange rate measures the number of units of one currency required to exchange with one unit of another. If exchange rate for pounds and rupees is: $£ 1=\mathbb{Z} 105$ or $£ 1: \mathbb{Z} 105$, then it means that one hundred and five rupees are needed to have one pound.
The exchange rate can fluctuate from year-to-year or even day-to-day. In a country, there are as many foreign exchange rates as there are foreign currencies. Like many other prices, exchange rate is determined by forces of demand and supply.

11.2 CURRENCY DEPRECIATION VS CURRENCY APPRECIATION 

Currency Depreciation

Currency Depreciation refers to decrease in the value of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency. It makes the domestic currency less valuable and more of it is required to buy the foreign currency.
For example:
(i) Rupee is said to be depreciating if price of $\$ 1$ rises from $\mathbb{Z} 81$ to $\mathbb{Z} 82$.
(ii) A change from $\$ 5=£ 4$ to $\$ 4.5=£ 4$ represents that UK pound is depreciating.

Effect of Depreciation of Domestic Currency

1. Increase in 'EXPORTS': Depreciation of domestic currency means a fall in the price of domestic currency (say, rupee) in terms of a foreign currency (say, US\$). It means, with same amount of dollars, more goods can be purchased from India, i.e. exports to USA will increase as they will become relatively cheaper.
2. Decrease in 'IMPORTS': Depreciation will lead to decrease in imports as Indians will have to pay more domestic currency to import foreign goods. It leads to fall in imports as foreign goods will become relatively costly.
3. Increase in 'NATIONAL INCOME': As exports will increase and imports will fall due to depreciation of domestic currency, Net Exports (= Exports - Imports) will increase. It will increase the National Income, assuming no change in other things (i.e. ceteris paribus).

Pay Attention to this

Often, a confusion arises when different statements are used to express a statement with same meaning. Let us discuss some statements, which have same meaning.
Note: All the options given below have been given in reference to depreciation of Domestic or Home Currency decreased (say, Rupee is said to be depreciating if price of $\$ 1$ rises from $\mathbb{Z} 81$ to $\mathbb{Z} 82$ ). In such cases, more Exports' and 'Fall in Imports', which will lead to 'Increase in National Income'.

1. Domestic or Home Currency has depreciated.

OR
2. There is a fall in the price of Domestic Currency.

3. Domestic Currency has become less valuable.

OR
4. Foreign Currency has become more valuable.

OR
5. Exchange Rate of Domestic Currency falls.

OR
6. There is a decrease in Exchange Rate of Home Currency.

OR
7. Exchange Rate of Domestic Currency has become weaker.

Currency Appreciation 

Currency Appreciation refers to an increase in the value of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency. As the domestic currency becomes more valuable, less of it is required to buy the foreign currency.
For example:
(i) Indian rupee appreciates when the price of $\$ 1$ falls from $\mathbb{\pi} 82$ to $\mathbb{\pi} 81$.
(ii) A change from $\$ 4.5=£ 4$ to $\$ 5=£ 4$ represents that the UK pound is appreciating.

Effect of Appreciation of Domestic Currency

1. Increase in 'IMPORTS': Appreciation of domestic currency means a rise in the price of domestic currency (say, rupee) in terms of a foreign currency (say, US\$). Now, one rupee can be exchanged for more \$, i.e. with same amount of money, more goods can be purchased from the USA. This leads to an increase in imports from the USA as American goods will become relatively cheaper.
2. Decrease in 'EXPORTS': Appreciation will lead to a decrease in exports as one unit of foreign currency will now buy less domestic goods. This will lead to a fall in exports as domestic goods will become relatively costly for foreign nationals.
3. Decrease in 'NATIONAL INCOME': As exports will fall and imports will rise due to appreciation of domestic currency, Net Exports will decrease. It will reduce the National Income, assuming there is no change in other things.

11.3 TYPES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEMS 

The three main types of foreign exchange rate systems are:

1. Fixed Exchange Rate System (or Pegged Exchange Rate System)
2. Flexible Exchange Rate System (or Floating Exchange Rate System)
3. Managed Floating Rate System

Fixed Exchange Rate System

Fixed exchange rate system refers to a system in which exchange rate for a currency is fixed by the government.

- The basic purpose of adopting this system is to ensure stability in foreign trade $\mathcal{E}$ capital movements.
- To achieve stability, the government undertakes to buy foreign currency when there is excess supply of foreign exchange and sells it when there is excess demand for foreign exchange.
- For this, government has to maintain large reserves of foreign currencies to maintain the exchange rate at the level fixed by it.
- Under this system, each country keeps value of its currency fixed in terms of some 'External Standard'.
- This external standard can be gold, silver, other precious metal, another country's currency or even some internationally agreed unit of account.
- When value of domestic currency is tied to the value of another currency, it is known as 'Pegging'.
- When value of a currency is fixed in terms of some other currency or in terms of gold, it is known as 'Parity value' of currency.


Merits of Fixed Exchange Rate System

1. Stability in the Exchange Rate: It provides stability to the foreign exchange market. There is no uncertainty, with respect to exchange rate, which promotes the foreign trade.
2. Promotes International Investment: It creates conditions for smooth flow of foreign capital between nations. Both, lender and borrower will not be prepared to lend or borrow in order to make long-term investments, if they are not sure about the rate of exchange. A stable exchange rate promotes international investments.
3. Promotes International Trade: It creates confidence among the people that the existing rate will continue in future. As a result, foreign trade of a country flows more quickly and smoothly.
4. Prevent Speculative Activities: As exchange rate is fixed by the government, it eliminates the possibility of speculative transactions in foreign exchange.
5. Co-ordination of Macroeconomic Policies: Since the world is economically interdependent, there is a need to coordinate the macro policies of different countries in order to keep the exchange rates fixed. It prevents countries from undertaking arbitrary and competitive depreciation or devaluation of their currencies which would be disadvantageous to their trading partners.

Demerits of Fixed Exchange Rate System

1. Huge Foreign Exchange reserves required: Government has to maintain large reserves of foreign currencies to maintain the exchange rate at the level fixed by it. It restricts the movement of capital in different parts of the world and hampers the international growth.

2. Difficulty in Fixing the Exchange Rate: It is very difficult to determine the level at which the exchange rate should be fixed. There may be undervaluation or overvaluation of currency. If the exchange rate is fixed at a level which is lower than the market level, it will result in deficit in balance of payments. If it is higher than the market level, then it may create inflationary pressure because of surplus in the balance of payments.
3. Exchange Rates are not fixed: Pegged (fixed) exchange rates are not permanently fixed. Often, fluctuations in the international commodity prices and problems in the balance of payments compel countries to bring changes in the exchange rates. This makes it difficult to keep the exchange rates fixed.

1 Gold Standard and Bretton Woods Standard 

In earlier times, exchange rates of all major countries were fixed according to the Gold Standard (18701914) and the Bretton Woods Standard (1944-1971).

According to Gold_Standard, external values of all currencies were maintained by fixing their prices in terms of gold. Central bank of each country was ready to buy and sell unlimited quantities of gold at a fixed price in terms of its own currency. For example, if $£ 1=5 \mathrm{gm}$ of gold and $\$ 1=2 \mathrm{gm}$ of gold, then exchange rate will be $£ 1=\$ 2.5$.
According to Bretton Woods Standard, gold was replaced by US dollar as the 'core' of the system. Under this system, all currencies were pegged or related to US dollar at a fixed exchange rate. This system gave birth to International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the central institution in the international monetary system.

Devaluation and Revaluation

Devaluation refers to reduction in the value of domestic currency by the government. Devaluation is said to occur when the exchange rate is increased by the government under Fixed Exchange Rate System. On the other hand, Revaluation refers to increase in the value of domestic currency by the government.

Devaluation Vs Depreciation

| Basis | Devaluation | Depreciation |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Meaning | Devaluation refers to reduction in price of domestic currency in terms of all foreign currencies under fixed exchange rate regime. | Depreciation refers to fall in market price of domestic currency in terms of a foreign currency under flexible exchange rate regime. |
| Occurrence | It takes place due to Government. | It takes place due to market forces of demand and supply. |
| Exchange Rate <br> System | It takes place under fixed exchange rate system. | It takes place under flexible exchange rate system. |

Flexible Exchange Rate System

Flexible exchange rate system refers to a system in which exchange rate is determined by forces of demand and supply of different currencies in the foreign exchange market.

- The value of a currency is allowed to fluctuate freely according to changes in the demand and supply of foreign exchange.
- There is no official (Government) intervention in the foreign exchange market.
- Flexible exchange rate is also known as 'Floating Exchange Rate' or 'Free Exchange Rate'.

- The exchange rate is determined by the market, i.e. through interactions of thousands of banks, firms and other institutions seeking to buy and sell currency for purposes of making transactions in foreign exchange.


Merits of Flexible Exchange Rate System 

1. Maintains Equilibrium Level: Flexible exchange rate is self-adjusting and automatically removes the disequilibrium in the Balance of Payments (BOP). It eliminates the problems of overvaluation and undervaluation of currencies.
2. No need for Huge Foreign Exchange reserves: There is no need for the government to hold large foreign exchange reserves. It enhances the movement of capital across different parts of the world and promotes international growth.
3. Optimum Utilisation of Resources: It provides the opportunity for optimum utilisation of resources and raises the level of efficiency in the economy.

Demerits of Flexible Exchange Rate System

1. Instability in the Exchange Rate: The external value of domestic currency keeps on changing as per demand and supply of foreign exchange. It creates uncertainty about the amount of receipts and payments in foreign exchange transactions. Such instabilities hamper foreign trade.
2. Speculative Activities: Speculators manipulate the market and make the exchange rates too low or too high. This makes the foreign exchange market unstable and discourages foreign trade and foreign investments.
3. Creates Inflationary Situation: It generates inflationary trends in the economy, when there is an increase in the prices of imports due to the depreciation of the currency.

Fixed Exchange Rate Vs Flexible Exchange Rate

| Basis | Fixed Exchange Rate | Flexible Exchange Rate |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Determination of Exchange Rate | It is officially fixed in terms of gold or any other currency by government. | It is determined by forces of demand and supply of foreign exchange. |
| Government Control | There is complete government control as only government has the power to change it. | There is no government intervention and it fluctuates freely according to market conditions. |
| Stability in Exchange Rate | The exchange rate generally remains stable \& only a small variation is possible. | The exchange rate keeps on changing. |
| Foreign Exchange Reserves | Government is required to keep a large stock of foreign exchange reserves to maintain the fixed rate of exchange at a particular level. | Foreign exchange reserves are not required to be kept under this system as exchange rate is set by the market forces of supply and demand. |
| Increase or Decrease in Value of Domestic Currency | Fixed Exchange Rate leads to: <br> - Devaluation, when there is decrease in the value of domestic currency by the government; or <br> - Revaluation, when there is an increase in the value of domestic currency by the government. | Flexible Exchange Rate leads to: <br> - Depreciation, i.e. decrease in value of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency by market forces of supply and demand; or <br> - Appreciation, i.e. increase in value of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency by market forces of supply and demand. |

Managed Floating Rate System 

Traditionally, International monetary economists have focused their attention on the framework of either Fixed or Flexible Exchange Rate System. With the end of Bretton Woods system, many countries have adopted the method of Managed Floating Exchange Rates.
It refers to a system in which foreign exchange rate is determined by market forces and central bank influences the exchange rate through intervention in the foreign exchange market.

- It is a hybrid (or mixture) of fixed exchange rate and a flexible exchange rate system.
- Like Flexible Exchange Rate System, exchange rate is primarily determined by forces of demand and supply; and
- Like Fixed Exchange Rate System, exchange rate is managed by way of intervention by RBI.
- In this system, central bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market to restrict the fluctuations in the exchange rate within certain limits. The aim is to keep exchange rate close to desired target values.
- For this, central bank maintains reserves of foreign exchange to ensure that the exchange rate stays within the targeted value.
- It is also known as 'Dirty Floating'. Dirty Float is a system in which value of a country's currency is allowed to change in relation to others, but is controlled or manipulated by Central Bank (RBI in case of India) to keep it within a particular range. It can be contrasted with a Clean Float, where the Central Bank does not intervene.


Example of Managed Floating Rate System

Suppose, India has a managed floating rate system and Indian central bank (RBI) wants to keep value of the rupee close to ₹ 82 per US Dollar.

- Further assume that RBI is ready to tolerate small fluctuations in the exchange rate, say, from ₹ 81.75 to ₹ 82.25 .
- Now, if due to excess demand for domestic currency, rupees become more valuable and price of \$1 falls below the level of ₹ 81.75 / dollar, then RBI will start increasing the supply of rupees by selling rupees for dollars and acquiring holdings of dollars.
- Similarly, if due to excess supply of rupees, it becomes less valuable and price of $\$ 1$ rises above the level of ₹ 82.25 / dollar, then RBI will increase the demand for rupees by exchanging dollars for rupees and running down its holdings of dollars.

Flexible Exchange Rate Vs Managed Floating Exchange Rate: Flexible exchange rate Is the rate which is determined by the supply and demand forces in foreign exchange market. It is free from intervention other than market forces. On the other hand, managed floating exchange rate is the market rate which can be influenced by the intervention of the central bank in the foreign exchange market. It is a tool to control unfavourable impacts of flexible exchange rate.

11.4 DEMAND FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE 

The demand (or outflow) of foreign exchange comes from those people who need it to make payments in foreign currency. It is demanded by the domestic residents for the following reasons:

1. Imports of Goods and Services: Foreign Exchange is demanded to make the payment for imports of goods and services.
2. Tourism: Foreign exchange is needed to meet expenditure incurred in foreign tours.
3. Unilateral Transfers sent abroad: Foreign exchange is required for making unilateral transfers like sending gifts to other countries.
4. Purchase of Assets in Foreign Countries: It is demanded to make payment for purchase of assets, like land, shares, bonds, etc. in the foreign countries.
5. Speculation: Demand for foreign exchange arises when people want to make gains from appreciation of currency.
For example, if people expect that the price of US dollar in terms of money will increase in future, they will buy more US dollars today. They will do so to make gains from appreciation of currency, i.e. in the expectation of making profits when dollar becomes expensive.
6. Repayment of International Loans: Loans from foreign countries are raised in foreign currency. So, foreign currency is needed to repay such loans.

Reasons for 'Rise in Demand' for Foreign Currency

The demand for foreign currency rises in the following situations:

1. When price of a foreign currency falls, imports from that foreign country become cheaper. So, imports increase and hence, the demand for foreign currency rises. For example, if price of 1 US dollar falls from ₹ 82 to ₹ 81 , then imports from USA will increase as American goods will become relatively cheaper. It will raise the demand for US dollars.
2. When a foreign currency becomes cheaper in terms of the domestic currency, it promotes tourism to that country. As a result, demand for foreign currency rises.
3. When price of a foreign currency falls, its demand rises as more people want to make gains from speculative activities.

Demand Curve of Foreign Exchange

Demand curve of foreign exchange slope downwards due to inverse relationship between demand for foreign exchange and foreign exchange rate.
In Fig. 11.1, demand for foreign exchange (US dollar) and rate of foreign exchange are shown on the $X$-axis and $Y$-axis respectively. The negatively sloped demand curve (DD) shows that more foreign exchange $\left(\mathrm{OQ}_{1}\right)$ is demanded at a low rate of exchange $\left(\mathrm{OR}_{1}\right)$, whereas, demand for US dollars falls to $\mathrm{OQ}_{2}$ when the exchange rate rises to $\mathrm{OR}_{2}$.
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

11.5 SUPPLY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE 

11.5 SUPPLY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE
supply of foreign exchange increases from any transaction that involves receipts of foreign currency. The supply (inflow) of foreign exchange comes from those people who receive it due to following reasons:

1. Exports of Goods and Services: Supply of foreign exchange comes through exports of goods and services.
2. Foreign Investment: The amount, which foreigners invest in the home country, increases the supply of foreign exchange.
3. Remittances (Unilateral transfers) from abroad: Supply of foreign exchange increases in the form of gifts and other remittances from abroad.
4. Speculation: Supply of foreign exchange comes from those who want to speculate on the value of foreign exchange.
5. Loans from Rest of the World: Borrowings from rest of the world contributes to supply of Foreign Exchange to India.
6. Grants and Donations from Abroad: Grants and donations from rest of the world also results in supply of Foreign Exchange.

Reasons for 'Rise in Supply' of Foreign Currency

The supply of foreign currency rises in the following situations:

1. When price of a foreign currency rises, domestic goods become relatively cheaper. It induces the foreign country to increase their imports from the domestic country. As a result, supply of foreign currency rises. For example, if price of 1 US dollar rises from ₹ 81 to ₹ 82 , then exports to USA will increase as Indian goods will become relatively cheaper. It will raise the supply of US dollars.
2. When price of a foreign currency rises, supply of foreign currency rises as people want to make gains from speculative activities.
3. When price of a foreign currency rises, investment from the foreign country into the domestic country also rises due to rise in purchasing power of foreign currency in the domestic country.
4. When price of a foreign currency rises, tourism into the domestic country rises as travelling to the domestic country becomes relatively cheaper.

Supply Curve of Foreign Exchange

Supply curve of foreign exchange slopes upwards due to positive relationship between supply for foreign exchange and foreign exchange rate.
In Fig. 11.2, supply of foreign exchange (US Dollar) and rate of foreign exchange are shown on the $X$-axis and $Y$-axis respectively. The positively sloped supply curve (SS) shows that supply of foreign exchange rises from $\mathrm{OQ}_{1}$ to $\mathrm{OQ}_{2}$ when the exchange rate rises from $\mathrm{OR}_{1}$ to $\mathrm{OR}_{2}$.
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Fig. 11.2

Let us now discuss 'Determination of Exchange Rate' under Flexible Exchange Rate System.

11.6 DETERMINATION OF EXCHANGE RATE 

Like the price of a commodity, flexible exchange rate is determined by the interaction of the forces of demand and supply. The equilibrium exchange rate is determined at a level where demand for foreign exchange is equal to the supply of foreign exchange. This will be clear from Fig. 11.3.
As seen in the diagram, demand and supply of foreign exchange are measured on the X -axis and rate of foreign exchange on the Y -axis. DD is the downward sloping demand curve of foreign exchange and SS is the upward sloping supply curve of foreign exchange. Both the curves intersect each other at point ' $E$ '. The Equilibrium Exchange Rate (or Par Rate of Exchange) is determined at OR and equilibrium quantity is determined at $O Q$.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

Fig. 11.3

Flexible rate of exchange is also known as 'Free rate of Exchange' as it is freely determined by market forces of demand and supply of foreign exchange.

Any Exchange Rate (other than OR) is not the Equilibrium Exchange Rate

- If the exchange rate rises to $\mathrm{OR}_{2}$, then demand for foreign exchange will fall to $\mathrm{OQ}_{2}$ and supply will rise to $\mathrm{OQ}_{1}$. It will be a situation of excess supply. As a result, exchange rate will fall till it again reaches the equilibrium level of OR.
- If exchange rate falls to $\mathrm{OR}_{1}$, then demand will rise to $\mathrm{OQ}_{1}$ and supply will fall to $\mathrm{OQ}_{2}$. It will be a case of excess demand. It will push up the exchange rate till it reaches OR.


11.7 CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATE

The equilibrium exchange rate will be disturbed if some changes occur in the demand or supply of foreign exchange.

Change in Demand

Change in demand may be either an 'Increase in Demand' or 'Decrease in Demand'.

(i) Increase in Demand: An increase in demand for

foreign exchange will shift the demand curve towards right from DD to $\mathrm{D}_{1} \mathrm{D}_{1}$. In Fig. 11.4, there is an excess demand of $\mathrm{QQ}_{3}$ at the original exchange rate of OR. As a result, the exchange rate rises to $\mathrm{OR}_{1}$. It shows that per unit price of US Dollar (in terms of rupees) has increased, i.e. domestic currency has depreciated.
![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

Fig. 11.4

(ii) Decrease in Demand: A decrease in demand will shift the demand curve towards left rate of OR. As a result, exchange rate will fall till it reaches $\mathrm{OR}_{2}$. Now, per unit price of US Dollar (in terms of rupees) has decreased, i.e. domestic currency has appreciated.

Change in Supply 

Change in supply may be either an 'Increase in Supply' or 'Decrease in Supply'.
(i) Increase in Supply: If supply of foreign exchange increases, it will lead to a rightward shift in supply curve from SS to $\mathrm{S}_{1} \mathrm{~S}_{1}$ as shown in Fig. 11.5. Now, at the original exchange rate of OR, there is an excess supply of $\mathrm{QQ}_{3}$. As a result, the new exchange rate moves down to $\mathrm{OR}_{1}$. This implies that per unit price of US Dollar (in terms of rupees) has reduced. A decrease in the price of foreign currency, in terms of domestic currency, means that the domestic currency has appreciated.
(ii) Decrease in Supply: A decrease in supply will shift the supply curve towards left (Fig. 11.5) from SS to $\mathrm{S}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{2}$. It leads to deficit supply
![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

Fig. 11.5
of $\mathrm{QQ}_{4}$ at the original exchange rate of OR. This will increase the exchange rate till it reaches $\mathrm{OR}_{2}$. So, per unit price of US Dollar (in terms of rupees) has increased and, thus, the domestic currency has depreciated.

11.8 FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET

Foreign exchange market is the market in which foreign currencies are bought and sold. The buyers and sellers include individuals, firms, foreign exchange brokers, commercial banks and the central bank.
Like any other market, foreign exchange market is a system, not a place. The transactions in this market are not confined to only one or few foreign currencies. In fact, there are a large number of foreign currencies which are traded, converted and exchanged in the foreign exchange market.

Functions of Foreign Exchange Market

Foreign exchange market performs the following three functions:

1. Transfer Function: It transfers purchasing power between the countries involved in the transaction. This function is performed through credit instruments like bills of foreign exchange, bank drafts and telephonic transfers.
2. Credit Function: It provides credit for foreign trade. Bills of exchange, with maturity period of three months, are generally used for international payments. Credit is required for this period in order to enable the importer to take possession of goods, sell them and obtain money to pay off the bill.

3. Hedging Function: When exporters and importers enter into an agreement to sell and buy goods on some future date at the current prices and exchange rate, it is called hedging. The purpose of hedging is to avoid losses that might be caused due to exchange rate variations in the future.

Kinds of Foreign Exchange Markets 

Foreign exchange markets are classified on the basis of whether the foreign exchange transactions are spot or forward. Accordingly, there are two kinds of foreign exchange markets: (i) Spot Market; (ii) Forward Market.
(i) Spot Market: Spot market refers to the market in which receipts and payments are made immediately. Generally, a time of two business days is permitted to settle the transaction. Spot market is of daily nature and deals only in spot transactions of foreign exchange (not in future transactions). The rate of exchange that prevails in the spot market, is termed as spot exchange rate or current rate of exchange.

The term 'spot transaction' is a bit misleading. In fact, spot transaction should mean a transaction, which is carried out 'on the spot' (i.e., immediately). However, a two-day margin is allowed as it takes two days for payments made through cheques to be cleared.
(ii) Forward Market: Forward market refers to the market in which sale and purchase of foreign currency is settled on a specified future date at a rate agreed upon today. The exchange rate quoted in forward transactions is known as the forward exchange rate. Generally, most of the international transactions are signed on one date and completed on a later date. Forward exchange rate becomes useful for both the parties involved in the transaction. Forward Contract is made for two reasons: (a) To minimise the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the exchange rate (through hedging); (b) To make profit (through speculation).

1. OTHER TYPES OF EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEM

Exchange rate regimes have evolved over a period of time in response to various changes in the global economic events. Fixed, Flexible and Managed floating exchange rate systems have already been discussed in the chapter. The other types of exchange rate regimes are:
(a) Adjustable Peg System: It refers to a system in which member countries fix the exchange rates of their currencies against one particular currency. The exchange rate is fixed for a particular period of time. However, a currency can be repegged at a lower rate (known as devaluation) or a higher rate (known as revaluation) under certain circumstances even before the expiry of the fixed period of time.
(b) Wider Band System: This system provides that a member country can change the exchange value of its currency within a range of 10 per cent. So, a member country is free to devalue or revalue its currency by 10 per cent to facilitate adjustment in the Balance of Payments. For example, if a country has a deficit in its balance of payments account, then its currency can be depreciated up to $10 \%$ from its parity value in order to correct the disequilibrium.
(c) Crawling Peg System: This system is a midway between dirty floating system and the adjustable peg system. According to this system, a country specifies the parity value for its currency and permits a small variation ( $\pm$ per cent) around that parity. The parity rate is adjusted regularly as required by the international reserve of the country changes in money supply and changes in the prices.

2. EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE (EER)

It refers to the measure of average relative strength of a given currency with respect to the other currencies. Effective Exchange Rate is of two types:
(i) Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER): It refers to the measure of average relative strength of a given currency with respect to the other currencies without eliminating the effect of price change.
(ii) Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER): When nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) is adjusted for the inflation differential, it is called as Real effective exchange rate.
