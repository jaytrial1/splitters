2.1 DOMESTIC TERRITORY (ECONOMIC TERRITORY)

Domestic territory is a very important concept in national income accounting. It is the territory administered by the government within which persons, goods and capital circulate freely. In layman's language, (domestic territory means the political frontiers of a country) However, for the purpose of national income accounting, it is used in a wider sense.

In addition to political frontiers, it also includes:

1. Ships and Aircraft owned and operated by normal residents between two or more countries. For example, planes operated by Air India between Russia and Japan are part of the domestic territory of India. Similarly, planes operated by Singapore Airways between India and Japan are a part of the domestic territory of Singapore.
2. Fishing vessels, oil and natural gas rigs and floating platforms operated by the residents of a country in the international waters where they have exclusive rights of operation. For example, fishing boats operated by Indian fishermen in international waters of Indian Ocean will be considered a part of domestic territory of India.
3. Embassies, consulates and military establishments of a country located abroad. For example, Indian Embassy in Russia is a part of the domestic territory of India.
'Consulate' is an office or building used by consul (an officer commissioned by the government to reside in a foreign country to promote the interest of the country to which he belongs).

Domestic Territory does not include: 

1. Embassies, consulates and military establishments of a foreign country For example, Japanese Embassy in India is a part of domestic territory of Japan.
2. International organisations like UNO, WHO, etc. located within the geographical boundaries of a country.
According to the United Nations, Economic Territory or domestic territory is the geographical territory, administered by a government within which, persons, goods and capital circulate freely.

2. Inclian Embassy in Japan.
3. Microsoft Office in India.
4. Branch of State Bank of India in China.
5. Company in India owned by a Japanese.
6. Russian Embassy in India.
7. Office of Reliance Industries in New York.
8. Tata rented its building to Google in America.
(Ans. Domestic Territory: 2, 3, 5, 6)

2.2 NORMAL RESIDENTS

Normal resident of a country refers to an individual or an institution who ordinarily resides in the country and whose centre of economic interest also lies in that country. Normal residents include both, individuals and institutions.

'Centre of Economic Interest' implies two things:

1. The resident lives or is located within the Domestic Territory; and
2. The resident carries out basic economic activities of earnings, spending and accumulation from that location.
Following are not included under the category of Normal residents:
3. Foreign tourists and visitors who visit a country for recreation, holidays, medical treatment, study, sports, conferences, etc.
4. Foreign staff of Embassies, officials, diplomats and members of the armed forces of a foreign country, located in the given country.
5. International organisations like UNO, WHO, etc. are not considered as normal residents of the country in which they operate. They are treated as the normal residents of international area.
6. Employees of international organisations are considered as residents of the countries to which they belong and not of the international area. For example, an American working in UNO office located in India will be treated as normal resident of America.

However, if the employees are working for more than one year in such International Institutions, then they become the normal resident of a country in which such institutions are located. It means, in the given example, if the American is working in UNO office in India for more than one year, then he will be treated as normal resident of India.
5. Crew members of foreign vessels, commercial travellers and seasonal workers, provided their stay is less than one year.

6. Border workers who live near the international border and cross the border on a regular basis to work in the other country. They are treated as normal residents of the country where they live, and not where they work.

Test Yourself 

Identify the following as Normal Residents of India:
(a) Indian officials working in the Indian Embassy in USA.
(b) A Japanese tourist who stays in India for 2 months.
(c) Indians going to Pakistan for watching the cricket match.
(d) Indians working in the UNO office, located in America for less than 1 year.
(e) Indian employees working in WHO, located in India.
(f) Foreign tourists visiting India for a month to see the Taj Mahal.
(g) Indian Muslims going for the Haj pilgrimage.
(Ans. Normal Residents: (a), (c), (d), (e), (g))

Citizenship and Residentship are two different terms

Citizenship

It is basically a legal concept based on the place of birth of the person or some legal provisions allowing a person to become a citizen. It means, Indian citizenship can arise in two ways:
(i) When a person is born in India, he acquires automatic citizenship of India.
(ii) A person born outside India applies for citizenship and Indian Law allows him to become Indian Citizen.

Residentship

- It is an economic concept based on the basic economic activities performed by a person.
- An individual is a normal resident of a country if he ordinarily resides in the country for a period more than one year and his centre of economic interest also lies in that country.

Example: A Chinese living in India for more than one year is a normal resident of India. However, he is not a citizen (or national) of India as he does not hold citizenship of India. Similarly, a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) is a citizen of India, but a resident of the country in which he lives. It means, a person can be a citizen of one country and at the same time, a resident of another country.

Domestic Product Vs National Product

The concepts of Domestic Territory and Normal Resident help to estimate 'Domestic Product' and 'National Product'.

1. The concept of Domestic territory helps to estimate 'Domestic Product'Domestic Product includes production activity of production units located in the economic territory irrespective of fact whether carried out by the residents or non-residents. It means, final goods and services produced by Foreign Nationals (like Honda, Pepsi, etc.) and by Indian Nationals (like Patanjali, Reliance, Tata, etc.) within the domestic territory of India, will be added to get India's domestic product without distinguishing between nationals and non-nationals. The money value of domestic product is termed as Domestic Income.
2. The concept of Normal Resident helps to estimate 'National Product' National Product includes production activities of normal residents irrespective of fact whether performed within the economic territory or outside it. The money value of national product is termed as National Income. The concepts of Domestic Income and National Income have been discussed in detail later in the chapter.

2.3 FACTOR INCOME AND TRANSFER INCOME 

Factor Income

Factor income refers to income received by factors of production* for rendering factor services in the production process.

- It is received for providing factor services of land, labour, capital and enterprise. As factor income is earned for contributing to production process, it is a Bilateral Income.
- Factor income of normal residents of a country is included in the National Income.
- Examples: Rent, wages, interest and profit.
- It should be noted that Factor Incomes and Factor Payments are the two sides of the same coin. It is factor income from the viewpoint of the owners of factors of production, while it is factor payment from the viewpoint of the producers of goods and services.
*Factors of Production are the primary inputs, which are needed to produce goods and services. They are broadly categorised under four heads: (i) Land; (ii) Labour; (iii) Capital; and (iv) Entrepreneur.


Transfer Income

Transfer income refers to income received without rendering any productive service in return.

- It is a unilateral (one-sided) concept.
- It is not included in National Income as it does not reflect any production of goods and services.
- It can be received either within the domestic territory of a country or from abroad.
- Examples: Old age pension, scholarship, unemployment allowance, pocket money, etc. Old age pension is a financial assistance provided to needy old people by the government without anything in return. It is not their earned income, i.e. it is a transfer income. On the other hand, retirement pension is like a deferred wage payment, which is related to factor services rendered by the recipient prior to the retirement. It is their earned income, i.e. it is a factor income.

Taxes received by the government are the transfer incomes of the government as they are received without providing any productive service in return. Similarly, subsidies paid by the government are transfer payments of the government.

Current Transfers Vs Capital Transfers

Transfer receipts are of two types: (i) Current Transfer; (ii) Capital Transfer.

1. Current transfers are made out of income, whereas, capital transfers are made out of the wealth of the payer.
2. Current transfers are generally regular in nature, whereas, capital transfers are irregular.
3. Current transfers are meant for consumption purposes, whereas, capital transfers are meant for capital formation.
4. Examples of Current transfers: Old age pension, gifts, unemployment allowance, etc. Examples of Capital transfers: Investment grant, capital gains tax, war damages, etc.

Factor Income Vs Transfer Income

| Basis | Factor Income | Transfer Income |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Meaning | It refers to income received by factors of production for rendering factor services in the production process. | It refers to income received without rendering any productive service in return. |
| Nature | It is included in both National Income and Domestic Income. | It is neither included in National Income nor in Domestic Income. |
| Concept | It is an earning concept. | It is a receipt concept. |
| Recipient | It is received by factors of production (land, labour, capital and enterprise). | It is generally received by households and government. |
| Example | Rent, Wages, Interest and Profit. | Scholarship, Old age pension, Unemployment allowance, etc. |

2.4 FINAL GOODS AND INTERMEDIATE GOODS 

All things that satisfy human wants are called goods. On the basis of end use of goods, they can be mainly classified into two heads: (i) Final Goods; and (ii) Intermediate Goods.

Final Goods

(Final goods refer to those goods which are used either for consumption or for investment.
Final Goods Include:
(i) Goods purchased by consumer households as they are meant for final consumption (like milk purchased by households).
(ii) Goods purchased by firms for capital formation or investment (like machinery purchased by a firm).
Expenditure on final goods purchased by households is called 'Consumption Expenditure' and expenditure on final goods purchased by the producers is called 'Investment Expenditure'. So, Expenditure on Final Goods = Consumption Expenditure + Investment Expenditure.

It must be noted that final goods are neither resold nor used for any further transformation in the process of production.

Intermediate Goods

(Intermediate goods refer to those goods which are used either for resale or for further production in the same year.)
Intermediate Goods include:
(i) Goods purchased for resale (like milk purchased by a Dairy Shop).
(ii) Goods used for further production (like milk used for making sweets).

Important Points about Intermediate Goods

- They are generally purchased by one production unit from another production unit, i.e. intermediate goods remain within the production boundary.

However, all purchases by one production unit from other production units are not intermediate purchases. For example, purchases of building, machinery, etc. are not intermediate purchases (if they are not meant for resale) as their value is not included in the value of final good. In fact, such purchases are termed as final products as they are purchased for investment.

- They have 'Derived Demand' as their demand depends on demand for final goods.
- They are not yet ready for use by their final users, i.e. some value has to be added to the intermediate goods. For example, Sugar purchased by a sweet shop is an intermediate good as some value is to be added to sugar for making sweets.
- Durable goods (like trucks, aircraft, vehicles, etc.) purchased by Government for military purposes are included under the category of intermediate goods as they are used to produce defence services and not for market sale.
- Value of intermediate goods is merged with the value of final goods. For instance, suppose a miller buys wheat worth ₹ 700 and converts it into flour worth ₹ 1,000 . Now, the value of flour (final good) includes the value of wheat (intermediate good).


Production Boundary 

The concept of production boundary is very significant to understand the difference between intermediate and final goods. The production boundary is the line around the productive sector. As long as goods remain within the production boundary, they are intermediate goods and when a good comes out of this boundary, it becomes a final good.
In the given diagram, there are 3 production units (A, B and C). The thick border drawn around these three
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
units is the Production Boundary. Within this limit, cotton and thread are intermediate goods. Cloth is a final good as it lies outside the purview of production boundary.

How to Classify Goods as: Intermediate Goods and Final Goods

The distinction between intermediate goods and final goods is made on the basis of the use of product and not on the basis of product itself. A commodity can be an intermediate good as will as a final good, depending upon its nature of use.

For Example:

(i) Sugar is an intermediate good when it is used by sweet shop for making sweets. However, if it is used by the consumers, then it becomes a final good.
(ii) Similarly, milk is an intermediate good when it is used in dairy shops for resale. However, it becomes a final good when it is used by the households.

So, it must be noted that distinction is made on the basis of end use. If end use of a good is consumption or investment, then it is a final good. However, if the good is used for resale or further production (in the same year), then it is an intermediate good.

National Income includes only Final Goods 

Only final goods are included in national income. The intermediate goods are not included in the national income as they are already included in the final goods. If their value is added again, it will lead to double counting.
For example, Out of wheat and flour, only flour (final good) is included in National Income as value of flour already includes the value of wheat (intermediate good).
The distinction between final and intermediate goods is required to estimate correct value of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In the absence of this distinction, GDP may be over-estimated and may lead to problem of double counting.

Goods used up in the same year are Intermediate Goods

It should always be remembered that intermediate goods are used up in the same year. If they remain for more than one year, then they are treated as final goods.
For example, suppose X Ltd. purchases 10 tonnes coal in 2024 for making glasses. Only 7 tonnes coal was used up in 2024. Now, 7 tonnes coal will be taken as intermediate goods and remaining 3 tonnes coal will be treated as final goods and will be included in National Income.

Final Goods Vs Intermediate Goods

| Basis | Final Goods | Intermediate Goods |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Meaning | Final goods refer to those goods which <br> are used either for consumption or for <br> investment. | Intermediate goods refer to those goods <br> which are used either for resale or for <br> further production in the same year. |
| Nature | They are included in both national and <br> domestic income. | They are neither included in national <br> income nor in domestic income. |
| Value addition | They are ready for use by their final users <br> i.e. no value has to be added to the final <br> goods. | They are not ready for use, i.e. some value <br> has to be added to the inter-mediate <br> goods. |
| Production Boundary | They have crossed the production <br> boundary. | They are still within the production <br> boundary. |
| Example | Milk purchased by households for <br> consumption, car purchased as an <br> investment. | Milk used in dairy shop for resale, coal <br> used in factory for further production. |

2.5 CONSUMPTION GOODS AND CAPITAL GOODS 

Final goods can be classified into two groups: Consumption Goods and Capital Goods.

Consumption Goods 

Consumption goods refer to those goods which satisfy the wants of the consumers directly. For example, Bread, butter, shirts, pens, television, furniture, etc.
Consumption goods can further be sub-divided into following categories:

1. Durable goods: It refers to those goods which can be used again and again over a considerable period of time. For example, television, refrigerators, etc.
2. Semi-durable goods: Goods which can be used for a limited period of time are termed as semidurable goods. These goods have a life span of around one year. For example, clothes, crockery, shoes, etc.
3. Non-durable goods: Goods which are used up in a single act of consumption are known as nondurable goods. These goods cannot be used more than once, i.e. they lose their identity in single act of consumption. For example, milk, bread, foodgrains, paper, etc.
4. Services: Services refer to non-material goods which directly satisfy the human wants. They are intangible activities, i.e. they can neither be seen nor touched. For example, services of teachers, doctors, banks, etc.

Capital Goods

Capital Goods are those final goods which help in production of other goods and services. For example, plant and machinery, equipments, etc.

Some Points about Capital Goods

(i) They are used in future for productive purposes and have expected life time of several years.
(ii) They do not lose their identity in the production process, i.e. they do not get merged in the process of production.
(iii) They need repairs or replacement over time as they depreciate over a period of time.
(iv) They have derived demand as their demand is derived from the demand for other goods, which they help to produce.
(v) Capital Goods are Durable Use Consumer Good for Households: When a good (say, refrigerator) is used by a producer (say, Confectionery Shop), then it is a Capital Good. However, the same good, i.e. refrigerator is a durable use consumer good for the households. So, if the end-user of a durable good is a producer, then it is a capital good. However, if the end-user is a household, then it is a durable use consumer good.

All Producer Goods are not Capital Goods

Producer goods are those goods which are used in the production of other goods. All goods used by producer, i.e. all producer goods are not capital goods. Producer goods include two types of goods:

- Single-use Producer Goods: It includes raw material like coal, wood, etc. They are not capital goods as they cannot be repeatedly used in the production process.
- Capital Goods: It includes fixed assets like plant and machinery, which can be repeatedly used in the production process.
So, it can be said that all capital goods are producer goods, but all producer goods are not capital goods.

Gross Investment 

Gross Investment is addition to the stock of capital before making allowance for depreciation. Capital stock consists of fixed assets and unsold stock. So, gross investment is the expenditure on purchase of fixed assets and unsold stock during the accounting year.

However, gross investment does not indicate the actual change in economy's stock of productive assets for a given year. During the production process, some amount of fixed capital is used up. This loss of fixed capital is known as depreciation. By subtracting depreciation from gross investment, we get Net Investment.

Net Investment

The actual addition made to the capital stock of economy in a given period is termed as Net Investment.

Net Investment = Gross Investment - Depreciation

Increase in net investment (or net capital formation) leads to increase in productive capacity of the economy as there is greater availability of capital per unit of labour.
Let us now understand the meaning of depreciation.

Depreciation (Consumption of Fixed Capital)

Depreciation refers to a fall in the value of fixed assets due to normal wear and tear, passage of time or expected obsolescence (change in technology). The concept of depreciation is very important to differentiate between Gross value and the Net value. 'Gross' is inclusive of depreciation, whereas, 'net' excludes it.
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Gross Value $=$ Net Value + Depreciation

Depreciation is also known as: (i) Current Replacement Cost; (ii) Replacement cost of Fixed Capital; (iii) Capital Consumption Allowance.

Depreciation Reserve Fund or Provision for Depreciation

Depreciation is also called consumption of fixed capital. It refers to that value of fixed capital (or fixed assets) which is consumed (or used up) in the process of production. Because of depreciation, fixed assets need to be replaced from time to time. Replacement of fixed assets requires funds. Provision for the funds is made on annual basis. To illustrate, if a machine is purchased for $₹ 10,00,000$ and its expected lifetime of use is 10 years, then the annual provision for funds (to replace the machine after 10 years) is $\frac{₹ 1,00,000(=₹ 10,00,000+10)$. The funds of $₹ 1,00,000$ so accumulated is called Depreciation Reserve Fund.

Depreciation of assets is mainly due to 3 reasons:
(i) Normal wear and tear: Continuous use of fixed assets in production process decreases their productive capacity and value.
(ii) Passage of time: Value of fixed assets also decreases with the passage of time, even if they are not being put to use in the business. Natural factors like rain, winds, weather, etc. contribute to fall in their value.

(iii) Expected obsolescence: Value of fixed assets also decreases due to expected obsolescence (i.e. loss in value due to change in technology or change in demand for goods and services).

Expected and Unexpected Obsolescence 

Value of fixed assets may decrease either due to 'Expected Obsolescence' or due to 'Unexpected Obsolescence'.

- Expected Obsolescence occurs due to change in technology or change in demand for goods and services. As expected obsolescence is an expected loss, it is managed by making provision for Depreciation Reserve Fund.
- Unexpected Obsolescence occurs due to natural calamities like earthquake, floods, etc. or due to thefts, accidents, etc. Loss of value of fixed assets due to unexpected obsolescence is termed as 'Capital Loss'.
It must be noted that only 'Expected Obsolescence' is considered for estimating depreciation and not the unexpected obsolescence.

Depreciation Vs Capital Loss

| Basis | Depreciation | Capital Loss |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Meaning | It refers to fall in the value of fixed assets due to normal wear and tear, passage of time or expected obsolescence. | It refers to loss in the value of the fixed assets due to unforeseen obsolescence, natural calamities, thefts, accidents, etc. |
| Provision for loss | Provision is made for replacement of assets as it is an expected loss. Provision is maintained through Depreciation Reserve fund. | No such provision is made in case of capital loss as it is an unexpected loss. However, insurance of fixed assets is done to minimise the loss. |
| Production process | It does not hamper the production process. | It hampers the production process. |

2.7 NET INDIRECT TAXES (NIT)

Net indirect taxes refer to the difference between indirect taxes and subsidies.
Net Indirect Taxes $=$ Indirect Taxes - Subsidies
Let us discuss the two components of NIT:

(i) Indirect Taxes

Indirect taxes refer to those taxes which are imposed by the government on production and sale of goods and services. For example, Goods and Services Tax (GST), Basic Customs Duty, Central Excise and VAT on Petroleum Products, Excise on Liquor, Electricity Duties, Stamp Duty, Securities Transaction Tax, Entry Taxes and Toll, etc.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

Indirect tax increases the price of the product in the market. For example, if cost of producing one set of speakers is ₹ 500 and Government levies GST of $10 \%$, then price of speakers will increase to ₹ 550 due to indirect taxes.

(ii) Subsidies 

Subsidies are the 'financial assistance' provided by the government to producers to fulfil its social welfare objectives. In India, LPG cylinder is sold at subsidized rates.

- They are often granted to promote exports or to encourage firms for setting up the industries in the backward areas.
- Subsidies are opposite to indirect taxes as they reduce the market price of the commodity. In the example of speakers, if the Government grants a subsidy of ₹ 10, then price of speakers will fall to ₹ 540 due to subsidies.
- Subsidies may also be referred as 'Economic Assistance' or 'Financial Assistance'.
- Subsidy is a 'Transfer Payment' as it is the financial assistance provided by the government to producers to fulfil its social welfare objectives. Government does not get anything in return in consideration for the same. Subsidy does not contribute to any value addition as it does not contribute to current flow of goods and services.


Factor Cost Vs Market Price

(a) Factor Cost (FC): It refers to amount paid to factors of production for their contribution in the production process. In the given example, ₹ 500 is the 'Factor Cost'.
(b) Market Price (MP): It refers to the price at which product is actually sold in the market. In the given example, ₹ 540 is the 'Market Price'. It includes the indirect taxes and excludes the
![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)
subsidies.
$\left(\begin{array}{l}\text { Market Price = Factor Cost + (Indirect Taxes - Subsidies) } \\ \text { Market Price = Factor Cost + Net Indirect Taxes }\end{array}\right)$

Calculate Net Indirect Taxes (NIT) in the following cases:
Case 1: (i) Indirect Taxes $=0$; (ii) Subsidies $=\mathfrak{\$ 1 0 0}$
Ans. NIT $=0-\mathfrak{\$} 100=-\mathfrak{\$ 1 0 0}$
Case 2: (i) Indirect Taxes $=\mathfrak{\$ 2 5 0}$; (ii) Subsidies $=0$
Ans. NIT $=\mathfrak{\$ 2 5 0}-0=\mathfrak{\$ 2 5 0}$
Case 3: (i) Indirect Taxes $=\mathfrak{\$ 2 0 0}$; (ii) Subsidies $=\mathfrak{\$ 1 2 0}$
Ans. NIT $=\mathfrak{\$ 2 0 0}-\mathfrak{\$ 1 2 0}=\mathfrak{\$ 8 0}$
The concept of NIT is very important to differentiate between Factor Cost and Market Price. 'Market Price includes net indirect taxes, whereas, 'Factor cost' excludes it. The concepts of indirect taxes and
relevant in a three-sector and four-sector economy.

2.8 NET FACTOR INCOME FROM ABROAD (NFIA) $\qquad$ It refers to the difference between factor income received from the rest of the world and factor income paid to the rest of the world.

NFIA = Factor income earned from abroad - Factor income paid abroad

- 'Factor income from abroad' is the income earned by the normal residents of a country from the Rest of the World (ROW) in the form of wages and salaries, rent, interest, dividend and retained earnings.
- 'Factor income to abroad' is the factor income paid to the normal residents of other countries (i.e. non-residents) for their factor services within the economic territory.


Significance of NFIA 

NFIA is significant to differentiate between 'Domestic Income' and 'National Income'. In practical estimates, domestic income is estimated first and then, National Income is derived from Domestic Income in the following manner:

National Income

$=$ Domestic Income

+ Factor income from abroad (due to contribution of normal residents to production outside the economic territory)
- Factor income to abroad (due to contribution of nonresidents to production inside the economic territory)
The difference of Factor income from abroad and Factor income to abroad is termed as "Net factor income from abroad" or popularly abbreviated as NFIA.

So, National Income $=$ Domestic Income + NFIA

NFIA can be Positive, Negative or Zero

- NFIA is Positive when income earned from abroad is more than income paid to abroad.
- NFIA is Negative when income earned from abroad is less than income paid to abroad.
- NFIA is Zero when income earned from abroad is equal to income paid to abroad.


Components of NFIA

There are three main components of NFIA:

1. Net Compensation to Employees: It refers to difference between income from work payments made to non-resident workers staying or employed within the domestic territory
2. Net Income from property and entrepreneurship: It refers to difference between income by residents of the country and similar payments made to the non-residents.

3. Net Retained Earnings: It refers to difference between retained earnings of resident companies located abroad and retained earnings of non-resident companies located within the domestic territory of the country.
Retained Earnings refer to that part of profits which is kept as reserve after paying the corporate tax and dividends.
Thus, it may be concluded that:

NET FACTOR INCOME FROM ABROAD (NFIA) 

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

It must be noted that NFIA is zero in a closed economy as such economy does not deal with the rest of the world sector.

Before we proceed further

Students must be very careful while dealing with Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA). Quite often, NFIA is given in different forms. Let us discuss treatment of NFIA in the following cases: Calculate NFIA in the following cases:
Case 1: (i) Factor income from abroad $=\mathbb{\pi} 500$; (ii) Factor income to abroad $=\mathbb{\pi} 300$
Ans. NFIA $=\mathbb{\pi} 500-\mathbb{\pi} 300=\mathbb{\pi} 200$
Case 2: (i) Factor income from abroad $=\mathbb{\pi} 250$; (ii) Factor income to abroad $=\mathbb{\pi} 620$
Ans. NFIA $=\mathbb{\pi} 250-\mathbb{\pi} 620=(-) \mathbb{\pi} 370$
Case 3: Factor income to abroad $=\mathbb{\pi} 150$
Ans. NFIA $=(-) \mathbb{\pi} 150$
Case 4: Factor income to abroad $=-\mathbb{\pi} 150$
Ans. NFIA $=\mathbb{\pi} 150$
