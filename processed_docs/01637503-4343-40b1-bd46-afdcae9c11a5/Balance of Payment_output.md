Balance of Payments 

12.1 MEANING OF BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

Every government keeps a record of the transactions that take place between the country and the rest of the world during a given period of time. This record is termed as the country's Balance of Payments (BOP). Balance of Payment is an accounting statement that provides a systematic record of all the economic transactions, between Residents of a country and the rest of the world, in a given period of time.

BOP is a summary statement in which all the 'Economic Transactions' between 'Residents' and the rest of the world are recorded during a particular period of time (usually one year).

Who are included in Residents?
Residents of a country include individuals, firms and government agencies. However, residents do not include Diplomatic staff, foreign military personnel, tourists, migratory workers and branches of foreign companies, even though they work and operate within the domestic territory of the country.

Economic Transactions

Economic transactions refer to those transactions which involve the transfer of the title or ownership of goods, services, money and assets. They are broadly categorised as under:

1. Visible Items: These include all types of physical goods which are exported and imported. These are called 'visible items' as they are tangible, i.e. they are made of some matter or material and can be seen, touched and measured. The movement of such items is open and can be verified by the custom officials.

2. Invisible Items: Invisible items of trade refer to all types of services like shipping, banking, insurance, etc., which are given and received. These are called invisible items as they cannot be seen, felt, touched or measured.
3. Unilateral Transfers: Unilateral transfers include gifts, personal remittances and other 'one-way transactions'. Since these transactions do not involve any claim for repayment, they are also known as unrequited transfers.
4. Capital Transfers: Capital transfers relate to capital receipts (through borrowings or sale of assets) and capital payments (through capital repayments or purchase of assets).

Structure of Balance of Payments 

Balance of payments accounting uses the 'Double Entry System' for recording transactions with the rest of the world. Like a typical business account, BOP account also has two sides:
(i) Credit side: All inflows or sources of foreign exchange are recorded on the credit side.
(ii) Debit side: All outflows or uses of foreign exchange are recorded on the debit side.

In the accounting sense, BOP is always balanced like Trial Balance as it is prepared as per double entry system. However, in an economic sense, BOP need not always be equal. It means, BOP can be:

- Balanced BOP: BOP is balanced when receipts of foreign exchange are equal to payments of toreign exchange.
- Surplus BOP: BOP is in surplus when receipts of foreign exchange are more than payments of foreign exchange.
- Deficit BOP: BOP is in deficit when receipts of foreign exchange are less than payments of foreign exchange.


Quick Recap of BOP

1. BOP is a systematic record of all economic transactions between residents of a country and rest of the world.
2. It includes transactions relating to visible items, invisible items, unilateral transfers \& capital transfers.
3. It is a flow concept as it is related to a given period of time.
4. It is prepared as per Double Entry System. Inflows of foreign exchange are recorded on the credit side and outflows on the debit side.

12.2 MEANING OF BALANCE OF TRADE

Balance of trade (BOT) refers to difference between the amounts of exports and imports of visible items (goods).

Balance of Trade = Exports of goods - Imports of goods Exports are entered as credit (positive) items in the BOP account, while imports are entered as the overall situation of BOP of a country. BOT is also known as 'Balance of Visible Trade' or 'Trade

Balance on Balance of Trade 

The balance of trade need not balance itself, i.e., it is not necessary that exports of goods are always equal to imports of goods. Balance on BOT can also be surplus (positive) or deficit (negative).

- Surplus BOT: If a country exports more goods than what it imports, then the balance of trade is said to be in surplus, i.e., balance of trade is 'favourable' for the country.
- Deficit BOT: If the import of goods exceeds the export of goods, then the country is said to have a deficit BOT, i.e., balance of trade is 'unfavourable' for the country.


Difference between Balance of Trade and Balance of Payments

Balance of trade and Balance of payments are two related terms, which are often used in the international economic scenario. However, they should be carefully distinguished from each other as they do not have the same meaning.
Let us analyse some of the important points of difference between the two:

| Basis | Balance of Trade (BOT) | Balance of Payments (BOP) |

12.3 COMPONENTS OF BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

All transactions in balance of payments can be grouped under two broad categories: (1) Current Account; (2) Capital Account. Let us discuss each of these accounts in detail.

Current Account

Current Account refers to an account which records all the transactions relating to export and import of goods and services and unilateral transfers during a given period of time. Current Account contains the receipts and payments relating to all the transactions of visible items, invisible items and unilateral transfers.
Current Account includes those transactions which do not impact assets and liabilities position of a country in relation to rest of the world, i.e. Current Account transactions do not give rise to future claims.

Components of Current Account 

The main components of Current Account are:

1. Export and Import of Goods (Merchandise Transactions or Visible Trade): A major part of transactions in foreign trade is in the form of export and import of goods (visible items). Payment for import of goods is written on the negative side (debit items) and receipt from exports is shown on the positive side (credit items). Balance of these visible exports and imports is known as Balance of Trade (or Trade Balance).
Trade Balance can be of two types:
(i) Trade Deficit: It refers to the excess of the payments for imports of visible items over the value of receipts of exports of visible items.
(ii) Trade Surplus: It refers to the excess of the receipts of exports of visible items over the value of payments for imports of visible items.
2. Export and Import of Services (Invisible Trade): It includes a large variety of services sold and purchased by the residents of a country, to and from the rest of the world. Payments are either received or made to other countries for use of these services. Payments for these services are recorded on the negative side and receipts on the positive side. Services are generally classified as:
(i) Factor Services: The monetary transactions related to factor incomes include Compensation of Employees and Investment Income. The investment income consists of income in the form of interest, rent and profits. Factor income receipts from abroad are recorded on the positive side of Balance of Payment Account, while payments to abroad are recorded on the negative side.
'Factor income receipts from abroad and payments to abroad' can also be taken as the fourth component of Current Account (as done in CBSE Marking Scheme).
(ii) Non-Factor Services: It includes all services other than factor services. Some main non-factor services are: (a) Shipping, (b) Banking, and (c) Insurance.
3. Unilateral or Unrequited Transfers to and from abroad (One-sided Transactions): Unilateral transfers include gifts, grants, personal remittances and other 'one-way' transactions. These refer to those receipts and payments, which take place without any service in return. Receipts of unilateral transfers from the rest of the world are shown on the credit side and unilateral transfers to the rest of the world on the debit side.
'INVISIBLES' in BOP Account: In the Invisible Account, there are three broad categories:
(i) Non-Factor Services such as travel, transportation, insurance and miscellaneous services;
(ii) Factor income, which includes Compensation of Employees and Investment Income; and
(iii) Unilateral Transfers, which do not involve any value in exchange.

Current Account shows the Net Income

Current Account records all the actual transactions of goods and services which affect the income, output and employment of a country. So, it shows the net income generated in the foreign sector.

Difference between Balance of Trade and Current Account

| Basis | Balance of Trade (BOT) | Current Account |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Components | Balance of trade includes only visible <br> items. | Current Account records both visible and <br> invisible items. |
| Scope | It is a narrow concept as it is only a part of <br> current account. | It is a wider concept and it includes BOT. |

Balance on Current Account 

In the current account, receipts from export of goods, services and unilateral receipts are entered as credit or positive items and payments for import of goods, services and unilateral payments are entered as debit or negative items. The net value of credit and debit balances is the balance on current account.

- Current Account Surplus (CAS) arises when credit items are more than debit items. It indicates a net inflow of foreign exchange. CAS arises when the value of exports of goods and services is more than the value of imports of goods and services. CAS signifies that the nation is a lender to the rest of the world.
- Current Account Deficit (CAD) arises when debit items are more than credit items, i.e. when foreign exchange receipts in the current account fall short of foreign exchange payments, it leads to a current account deficit. It indicates net outflow of foreign exchange. CAD arises when the value of exports of goods and services is less than the value of imports of goods and services. CAD signifies that the nation is a borrower from the rest of the world.

Components of Current Account

| Credit items | Debit Items | Net Credit (Credit-Debit) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1. Visible Trade <br> Exports of goods | Imports of goods | Net exports of goods <br> (Balance of trade) |
| 2. Invisible Trade <br> Exports of Services | Imports of services | Net Exports of Services |
| 3. Unilateral Transfers <br> Transfer Receipts | Transfer Payments | Net transfer Receipts |
| Current Receipts $(1+2+3)$ | Current Payments | Current Account Balance |

Capital Account

Capital account of BOP records all those transactions, between the residents of a country and the rest of the world, which cause a change in the assets or liabilities of the residents of the country or its government. It is related to claims and liabilities of financial nature. Capital Account is used to: (i) Finance deficit in current account; or (ii) Absorb surplus of current account.
Capital Account is concerned with financial transfers. So, it does not directly affect the country's income, output and employment.

Components of Capital Account

The main components of capital account are:

1. Borrowings and lendings to and from abroad: It includes:

- All transactions relating to borrowings from abroad by private sector, government, etc. Receipts of such loans and repayment of loans by foreigners are recorded on the positive (credit) side.
- All transactions of lending to abroad by private sector and government. Lending abroad and repayment of loans to abroad is recorded as negative or debit item.

2. Investments to and from abroad: It includes:

- Investments by the rest of the world in shares of Indian companies, real estate in India, etc. Such investments from abroad are recorded on the positive (credit) side as they bring in foreign exchange.
- Investments by Indian residents in shares of foreign companies, real estate abroad, etc. Such investments to abroad are recorded on the negative (debit) side as they lead to outflow of foreign exchange.


Investments to and from abroad' includes two types of investments 

(i) Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): It refers to purchase of an asset, such that it gives direct control to the purchaser over the asset. For example, purchase of land and building.
(ii) Portfolio Investment: It refers to purchase of an asset, such that it does not give any direct control over the asset to the purchaser. For example, purchase of shares. It also includes Foreign Institutional Investment (FII).
3. Change in Foreign Exchange Reserves: Foreign exchange reserves are the financial assets of the government held by the central bank. A change in reserves serves as the financing item in India's BOP. So, any withdrawal from the reserves is recorded on the positive (credit) side and any addition to these reserves is recorded on the negative (debit) side. It must be noted that 'change in reserves' is recorded in the BOP account and not 'reserves'.
It must be noted that export and import of Capital Goods (like Plant and Machinery, Equipments, etc.) are included in Current Account under the head visible items and not in Capital Account.

Balance on Capital Account

The transactions, which lead to inflow of foreign exchange (like receipt of loan from abroad, sale of assets or shares in foreign countries, etc.) are recorded on the credit or positive side of capital account. Similarly, transactions, which lead to outflow of foreign exchange (like repayment of loans, purchase of assets or shares in foreign countries, etc.) are recorded on the debit or negative side. The net value of credit and debit balances is the balance on capital account.

- Surplus in capital account arises when credit items are more than debit items. It indicates net inflow of capital.
- Deficit in capital account arises when debit items are more than credit items. It indicates net outflow of capital.

In addition to current account and capital account, there is one more element in BOP, known as 'Errors and Omissions'. It is the balancing item, which reflects the inability to record all international transactions accurately.

Components of Capital Account

| Credit Items | Debit Items | Net Credit (Credit-Debit) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1. Borrowings and lendings to <br> and from abroad <br> Borrowings from abroad | Lendings to abroad | Net Borrowings from abroad |

Balance on Current Account Vs Balance on Capital Account
Balance on current account and balance on capital account are interrelated. In accounting sense, Current Account + Capital Account $=0$.

- If an economy is facing the situation of Current Account Deficit (CAD), the same must be financed through surplus in Capital Account. CAD may be set-off through net capital inflows, like selling of assets or borrowing from abroad.
- Similarly, if the economy is facing the situation of Current Account Surplus (CAS), the same must be matched by a deficit on the Capital Account. CAS may be set-off through net capital outflows, like purchase of assets or repayment of loans.

Difference between Current Account and Capital Account

| Basis | Current Account | Capital Account |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Influence on the <br> economy | Current account transactions bring a <br> change in the current level of a country's <br> income. | Capital account transactions bring about <br> a change in the capital stock of a country. |

| Components | Current Account = Visible Trade + Invisible <br> Trade + Unilateral transfers | Capital Account = Borrowings and lendings <br> to and from abroad + Investments to <br> and from abroad + Change in Foreign <br> Exchange Reserves |

12.4 AUTONOMOUS AND ACCOMMODATING ITEMS 

The transactions recorded in the balance of payments accounts can be categorized as 'Autonomous Transactions' \& 'Accommodating Transactions'. Let us discuss each of them in detail.

Autonomous Items

Autonomous items refer to those international economic transactions that take place due to some economic motive such as profit maximisation. These items are also known as 'above the line items'.
Autonomous transactions are independent of the state of BOP account. For example, if a foreign company is making investments in India with the aim of earning profit, then such a transaction is independent of the country's BOP situation. Autonomous transactions take place on both current and capital accounts.

- On the current account, merchandise exports and imports of goods are autonomous transactions.
- On the capital account, receipts and repayments of long-term loans by private individuals are autonomous transactions.

Surplus or Deficit in BOP: Autonomous items are cause of BOP imbalance (BOP surplus or deficit)

- BOP account is in surplus when autonomous receipts are more than the autonomous payments.
- BOP is in deficit when autonomous receipts are less than autonomous payments.


Accommodating Items 

Accommodating items refer to the transactions that are undertaken to cover the gap in the balance of payments, i.e. such transactions are undertaken to cover deficit or surplus in autonomous transactions. These items are also known as 'below the line items'.
Accommodating transactions are compensating capital transactions which are meant to correct the disequilibrium in autonomous items of balance of payments. For example, if there is a current account deficit in the BOP, then this deficit is settled by capital inflow from abroad. The sources used to meet a deficit in BOP, are: (i) Foreign exchange reserves; (ii) Borrowings from IMF or foreign monetary authorities.

Autonomous Items Vs Accommodating Items

| Basis | Autonomous items | Accommodating items |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Meaning | Autonomous items refer to those international economic transactions that take place due to some economic motive such as profit maximisation. | Accommodating items refer to the transactions that are undertaken to cover deficit or surplus in autonomous transactions. |
| Effect on BOP account | Autonomous transactions are independent of the state of BOP account. | Accommodating transactions are undertaken to maintain the balance in BOP account. |
| Current/Capital <br> Account | Autonomous transactions take place on both current and capital accounts. | Accommodating transactions take place only on capital account. |
| Alternate Name | These items are also known as 'above the line items. | These items are also known as 'below the line items'. |

BOP is always Balanced in Accounting Sense

As stated before, BOP is based on the principles of double entry system. Any deficit or surplus created through autonomous transactions is corrected by the corresponding surplus or deficit in the accommodating transaction by monetary authority.

12.5 DEFICIT OR SURPLUS IN THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

There is little possibility for the balance of payments to be in equilibrium during a given period of time. Disequilibrium in BOP of a country may be either in the form of deficit or as a surplus. problems for the economy.

- Deficit in Balance of Payments Account arises when total inflows on account of autonomous transactions are less than total outflows on account of such transactions.
- On the other hand, Surplus in Balance of Payments Account arises when total inflows on account of autonomous transactions exceed total outflows on account of such transactions.


Official Reserve Transactions 

The transactions carried on by monetary authorities of a country, which causes changes in official reserves are termed as Official Reserve Transactions. Autonomous receipts and autonomous payments give rise to either deficit or surplus on Balance of Payments. The Central Bank may finance a deficit by:
(i) Reducing reserves of foreign currency.
(ii) Borrowings from monetary authorities like IMF.

The Central Bank may use surplus to purchase foreign securities, foreign currency, gold, etc. which may result in increase in reserves of the nation.
