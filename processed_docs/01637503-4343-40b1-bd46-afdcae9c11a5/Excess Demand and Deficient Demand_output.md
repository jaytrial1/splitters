9.1 INTRODUCTION

In the previous chapter, we discussed that equilibrium level of income and employment is determined when AD (or $\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{I}$ ) curve intersects the AS curve. According to Keynes, the equilibrium level of employment may or may not be the full employment level. It means, equilibrium level may exceed or fall short of full employment level.
If equilibrium level exceeds the full employment level, then there is excess demand in the economy. However, if equilibrium level falls short of full employment level, then it is a situation of deficient demand.

9.2 EXCESS DEMAND

Excess demand refers to the situation when aggregate demand (AD) is more than the aggregate supply (AS) corresponding to the full employment level of output in the economy. It is the excess of anticipated expenditure over the value of full employment output.
Excess demand gives rise to an inflationary gap. Inflationary gap refers to the gap by which actual aggregate demand exceeds the aggregate demand required to establish full employment equilibrium. It is called inflationary because this leads to a rise in general price level of the economy. The concepts of excess demand and inflationary gap are

Fig. 9.1

In the diagram, income, output and employment are measured on the X -axis and aggregate demand is measured on the Y -axis. Aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS) curves intersect at point $E$, which indicates the full employment equilibrium. Due to increase in investment expenditure ( $\Delta \mathrm{I}$ ), aggregate demand rises from AD to $\mathrm{AD}_{1}$. It denotes the situation of excess demand and the gap between them, i.e., EF is termed as inflationary gap.

It must be noted that the situation of excess demand generates inflationary pressure in the economy. Larger the inflationary gap, greater will be the inflationary pressure on the economy.

Reasons for Excess Demand 

Excess demand may arise due to several factors. Important, among them, are mentioned below:

1. Rise in the Propensity to consume: Excess demand may arise because of an increase in consumption expenditure due to a rise in the propensity to consume or fall in the propensity to save.
2. Reduction in taxes: It may also occur due to increase in disposable income and consumption demand because of decrease in taxes.
3. Increase in Government Expenditure: Rise in government demand for goods and services due to increase in public expenditure will also result in excess demand.
4. Increase in Investment: Excess demand can also arise when there is increase in investment due to decrease in rate of interest or increase in expected returns.
5. Fall in Imports: Decrease in imports due to higher international prices in comparison to domestic prices may also lead to excess demand.
6. Rise in Exports: Excess demand may also arise when demand for exports increases due to comparatively lower prices of domestic goods or due to decrease in the exchange rate for domestic currency.
7. Deficit Financing: Excess demand may be caused due to increase in the money supply caused by deficit financing.
It must be noted that the main reason for excess demand is apparently the increase in four components of aggregate demand.

Impact of Excess Demand

Excess demand is not a desired situation because it does not lead to any increase in level of aggregate supply as the economy is already at full employment level. Excess demand has the following effect on output, employment and general price level:

1. Effect on Output: Excess demand does not affect the level of output because economy is already at full employment level and there is no idle capacity in the economy.
2. Effect on Employment: There will be no change in the level of employment as the economy is already operating at full employment equilibrium and there is no involuntary unemployment.
3. Effect on General Price Level: Excess demand leads to a rise in the general price level (known as inflation) as aggregate demand is more than aggregate supply.

9.3 DEFICIENT DEMAND 

Deficient demand refers to the situation when aggregate demand (AD) is less than the aggregate omply (AS) corresponding to full employment level of output in the economy.
The situation of deficient demand arises when planned aggregate expenditure falls short of aggregate supply at the full employment level. It gives rise to deflationary gap. Deflationary omp is the gap by which actual aggregate demand falls short of aggregate demand required to establish full employment equilibrium.
The concepts of deficient demand and deflationary gap are shown in Fig. 9.2. As seen in the diagram, income, output and employment are measured on the X -axis and aggregate demand is measured on the Y -axis. Aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS) curves intersect at point E , which indicates the full employment equilibrium. Due to decrease in investment expenditure ( $\Delta \mathrm{I}$ ), aggregate demand falls from AD to $\mathrm{AD}_{1}$. It denotes the situation of deficient demand and the gap between them, i.e., EG is termed as deflationary gap. Point F indicates the underemployment equilibrium.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

Fig. 9.2

It may be noted that during deficient demand, equilibrium is determined at a level less than full employment equilibrium. It leads to underemployment equilibrium. In this situation, there exists involuntary unemployment.

Reasons for Deficient Demand

The reasons for occurrence of deficient demand are almost opposite to the reasons for excess demand. The main causes for deficient demand are:

1. Decrease in Propensity to consume: A decrease in consumption expenditure, due to fall in the propensity to consume, leads to deficient demand in the economy.
2. Increase in taxes: AD may also fall due to imposition of higher taxes. It leads to decrease in disposable income and, as a result, the economy suffers from deficient demand.
3. Decrease in Government Expenditure: When government reduces its demand for goods and services due to fall in public expenditure, it leads to deficient demand.
4. Fall in Investment expenditure: Increase in the rate of interest or fall in the expected returns lead to decrease in the investment expenditure. It reduces the AD and gives rise to deficient demand.
5. Rise in Imports: When international prices are comparatively less than the domestic prices, then it may lead to a rise in imports, implying a cut in the aggregate demand.
6. Fall in Exports: Exports may fall due to comparatively higher prices of domestic goods or due to increase in the exchange rate for domestic currency. This will lead to deficient demand.

Impact of Deficient Demand 

Deficient demand creates many difficulties in the economy due to its deflationary nature. Generally, deficient demand adversely affects the level of output, employment and price level in the economy.

1. Effect on Output: Due to lack of sufficient aggregate demand, there will be an increase in the inventory stock. It will force the firms to plan for lesser production for the subsequent period. As a result, planned output will fall.
2. Effect on Employment: Deficient demand causes involuntary unemployment in the economy due to fall in the planned output.
3. Effect on General Price Level: Deficient demand causes the general prices to fall due to lack of demand for goods and services in the economy.

9.4 EXCESS DEMAND VS DEFICIENT DEMAND

| Basis | Excess Demand | Deficient Demand |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Meaning | It refers to the situation when AD is more than AS corresponding to full employment level in the economy. | It refers to the situation when AD is less than AS corresponding to full employment level in the economy. |
| Inflationary or Deflationary Gap | It leads to Inflationary Gap (Fig. 9.1). | It leads to Deflationary Gap (Fig. 9.2). |
| Equilibrium level | It indicates over full employment equilibrium. | It indicates underemployment equilibrium. |
| Reason | It occurs due to excess of anticipated expenditure, i.e. due to rise in consumption expenditure, investment expenditure, etc. | It occurs due to shortage of anticipated expenditure, i.e. due to fall in consumption expenditure, investment expenditure, etc. |
| Impact on Output and Employment | It does not affect the output and employment as economy is already operating at full employment level. | It leads to fall in output and employment due to a shortage of aggregate demand. |
| Impact on Price | It leads to inflation, i.e. it results in rise in general price level. | It leads to deflation, i.e. it results in fall in general price level. |

It is clear from the discussion that both the situations of excess and deficient demand are harmful for the growth of the economy. They hamper the economic growth by giving rise to Trade Cycles (discussed in Power Booster). So, it is very important to take measures to control excess and deficient demand.

9.5 MEASURES TO CONTROL EXCESS AND DEFICIENT DEMAND

The problems of excess demand and deficient demand occur when the current aggregate demand is more or less than the aggregate demand required for full employment equilibrium. These problems can be solved by bringing a change in the level of aggregate demand in the economy. There are number of measures to control excess and deficient demand. However, the scope of the syllabus restricts the study of following measures:

1. Change in Government Spending 

Government spending is an important component of aggregate demand. This measure is a part of Fiscal Policy and is termed as 'Expenditure Policy' of the Government. The government spends a huge amount on public works like construction of roads, flyovers, buildings, railway lines, etc. Changes in such expenditure directly affect the level of AD in the economy and help to control the situations of excess and deficient demand.

2. Change in Taxes

Taxes' is the main source of revenue for the government. This measure is a part of Fiscal Policy and is termed as 'Revenue Policy' of the Government. Government imposes different kinds of direct and indirect taxes on the public. Changes in taxes by the government directly influence the level of aggregate demand and help to control excess and deficient demand in the economy.

For other measures of Fiscal Policy, please refer Power Booster.

3. Change in Money Supply or Availability of Credit

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is empowered to regulate the money supply in the economy through its 'Monetary Policy'. It is a policy adopted by the Central Bank of an economy in the direction of credit control or money supply. Monetary policy helps to control the situations of excess and deficient demand through its following instruments:
(i) Quantitative Instruments: These instruments aim to influence the total volume of credit in circulation. Major instruments or measures are: (a) Bank Rate and Repo Rate, (b) Reverse Repo Rate, (c) Open Market Operations, and (d) Legal Reserve Requirements.
(ii) Qualitative Instruments: These instruments aim to regulate the direction of credit. Major qualitative instruments or measures are: (a) Margin Requirements, (b) Moral Suasion, and (c) Selective Credit Controls.

Let us now discuss how 'Change in Government Spending', 'Change in Taxes' and 'Change in Money Supply or Availability of Credit' helps to correct Excess Demand and Deficient Demand.

9.6 MEASURES TO CORRECT EXCESS DEMAND

During excess demand, the current aggregate demand in the economy is more than the full employment level of output. It happens because of rise in money supply and availability of credit at easy terms. In order to correct Excess Demand, the following measures may be adopted:

Decrease in Government Spending

It is a part of Fiscal Policy. The government spends a huge amount on infrastructural and administrative activities. To control the situation of excess demand, Government should reduce its expenditure to the maximum possible extent. More emphasis should be placed to reduce expenditure on defence and unproductive works as they rarely help in growth of a country. Decrease in Government spending will reduce the level of aggregate demand in the economy and helps ${ }^{10}$ correct inflationary pressures in the economy.

9.6 

Increase in Taxes

During excess demand, government increases the rates of taxes and even imposes some new taxes. It leads to decrease in the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy and helps to control the situation of excess demand.

Decrease in Money Supply or Availability of Credit

The Central Bank (RBI) aims to reduce availability of credit in the economy through its 'Monetary Policy'. Two major instruments of Monetary Policy used to decrease money supply are:
(i) Quantitative Instruments; (ii) Qualitative Instruments.
(i) Quantitative Instruments

1. Increase in Bank Rate: Bank rate is the rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks to meet their long-term needs. During excess demand, central bank increases the bank rate, which raises the cost of borrowings from the central bank. It forces the commercial banks to increase their lending rates, which discourages borrowers from taking loans. It reduces the availability of credit in the economy and helps to correct excess demand.
2. Increase in Repo Rate: Repo rate is the rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks to meet their short-term needs. During excess demand, central bank increases the repo rate, which increases the cost of borrowings from the central bank. As a result, commercial banks are forced to increase their lending rates. It discourages the borrowers from taking loans and reduces the availability of credit in the economy, which helps to correct the excess demand.

Repo Rate Vs Bank Rate

As discussed earlier in the "Banking" chapter, both repo rate and bank rate are almost similar except that repo rate is applicable to short-term lending by the central bank, while bank rate is applicable to longterm lending by the central bank. Both are used in the same manner to control inflation. But, Repo rate mainly aims for short-term effect and Bank rate mainly aims for long-term effect.
3. Increase in Reverse Repo Rate: Reverse Repo Rate is the rate of interest at which commercial banks can deposit their surplus funds with the Central Bank, for a relatively shorter period of time. To deal with the situation of excess demand, Reverse Repo Rate may be increased by the Central Bank. It encourages the Commercial Banks to park their surplus funds with the Central Bank. It will reduce the credit creating power of Commercial Banks. As a result, consumption expenditure and investment expenditure may get reduced, leading to reduction in Aggregate Demand.
4. Open Market Operations (Sale of securities): Open market operations refer to sale and purchase of securities in the open market by the central bank. It directly influences the level of money supply in the economy. During excess demand, central bank offers securities for sale. Sale of securities reduces the reserves of commercial banks. It adversely affects the bank's ability to create credit and decreases the level of aggregate demand in the economy.

5. Increase in Legal Reserve Requirements (LRR): Commercial banks are obliged to maintain legal reserves. An increase in such reserves is a direct method to reduce the availability of credit. There are two components of legal reserves:
(i) Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR): It is the minimum percentage of net demand and time liabilities, to be kept by commercial banks with the central bank.
(ii) Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR): It refers to minimum percentage of net demand and time liabilities, which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves. To correct the excess demand, the central bank increases CRR or/and SLR. It reduces the amount of effective cash resources of commercial banks and limits their credit creating power. It ultimately helps in reducing credit availability in the economy.

III) Qualitative Instruments 

1. Increase in Margin Requirements: Margin requirement refers to difference between the market value of security offered and the value of amount lent. When the economy is suffering from excess demand, central bank increases the margin, which restricts the credit creating power of banks. Borrowers find it less attractive to borrow money and it decreases the level of aggregate demand.
2. Moral Suasion (Advise to Discourage Lending): This is a combination of persuasion and pressure that Central Bank applies on other banks in order to get them act, in a manner, in line with its policy. Moral suasion is exercised through discussions, letters, speeches and hints given to banks. During excess demand, the central bank advises, requests or persuades the commercial banks not to advance credit for speculative or non-essential activities. It helps to reduce availability of credit and aggregate demand.
3. Selective Credit Controls (Introduce Credit Rationing): It refers to a method in which the central bank gives directions to other banks to give or not to give credit for certain purposes to particular sectors. During excess demand, the central bank introduces rationing of credit in order to prevent excessive flow of credit, particularly for speculative activities. It helps to wipe off excess demand.

9.7 MEASURES TO CORRECT DEFICIENT DEMAND 

During a situation of deficient demand, the level of aggregate demand in the economy is less than the full employment level of output. It happens due to decrease in money supply and availability of credit. The measures adopted to control deficient demand are just the opposite of the measures used in excess demand.
Following measures may be adopted to correct the deficient demand:

Increase in Government Spending

It is a part of Fiscal Policy. Government incurs expenditure on infrastructural and administrative activities. During deficient demand, the government should increase expenditure on public works like construction of roads, flyovers, buildings, etc. with a view to provide additional income to people. This will increase the aggregate demand and will help to correct the situation of deficient demand.

Decrease in Taxes

During deficient demand, government reduces the rates of taxes and even abolishes some of the taxes. It raises the purchasing power of people. Due to increase in disposable income, people are able to spend more on consumption and investment. It raises the level of aggregate demand and helps to control the situation of deficient demand.

Increase in Money Supply or Availability of Credit

During deflationary situations, the central bank aims to ensure easy availability of credit and reducing cost of borrowing money through its 'Monetary Policy'. Two major instruments are: (i) Quantitative Instruments; (ii) Qualitative Instruments.

(i) Quantitative Instruments

1. Decrease in Bank Rate: Bank rate is the rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks to meet their long-term needs. During deficient demand, the central bank reduces the bank rate in order to expand credit. It leads to a fall in the market rate of interest which induces people to borrow more funds. It ultimately leads to an increase in the aggregate demand.
2. Decrease in Repo Rate: Repo rate is the rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks to meet their short-term needs. During deficient demand, the central bank decreases the repo rate to expand credit. It leads to fall in the interest rates which induces people to borrow more funds and helps to increase the aggregate demand.
3. Decrease in Reverse Repo Rate: Reverse Repo Rate is the rate of interest at which commercial banks can deposit their surplus funds with the Central Bank, for a relatively shorter period of time. To control the situation of deficient demand, this rate may be decreased by the Central Bank. It discourages Commercial Banks from depositing their surplus funds with the Central Bank. It will raise the credit creating power of Commercial Banks, which will increase the consumption expenditure \& investment expenditure, leading to rise in Aggregate Demand.
4. Open Market Operations (Purchase of securities): Open market operations refer to sale and purchase of securities in the open market by the central bank. It directly influences the level of money supply in the economy. During deficient demand, the central bank starts purchasing securities from the open market. It increases the money supply and enhances the purchasing power capacity and increases level of aggregate demand in the economy.

Excess Demand and Deficient Demand 

9.9

Decrease in Legal Reserve Requirements (LRR): Commercial banks are obliged to maintain legal reserves. Decrease in such reserves helps to raise the availability of credit. There are two components of legal reserves:
(i) Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR): It is the minimum percentage of net demand and time liabilities to be kept by commercial banks with the central bank.
(ii) Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR): It refers to a minimum percentage of net demand and time liabilities, which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves. To correct the deficient demand, the central bank decreases CRR or/and SLR. It increases the amount of effective cash resources of commercial banks and enhances their credit creating power. It will raise the level of borrowings and helps to minimise the deficiency in demand.

Qualitative Instruments

1. Decrease in Margin Requirements: Margin requirement refers to difference between the market value of security offered and the value of amount lent. During deficient demand, central bank reduces the margin, which enhances the credit creating power of banks. With decrease in margin, commercial banks can grant more loans than before, against the same amount of security. It encourages the borrowers to borrow more money and raises the level of aggregate demand.
2. Moral Suasion (Advise to Encourage Lending): This is a combination of persuasion and pressure that Central Bank applies on other banks in order to get them act, in a manner, in line with its policy. During deficient demand, the central bank advises, requests or persuades the commercial banks to encourage credit. It helps to raise availability of credit and aggregate demand.
3. Selective Credit Controls (Withdraw Credit Rationing): It refers to a method in which the central bank gives directions to other banks to give or not to give credit for certain purposes to particular sectors. During deficient demand, the central bank withdraws rationing of credit and make efforts to encourage credit.

9.8 EXCESS AND DEFICIENT DEMAND IN THREE-SECTOR ECONOMY 

In a three-sector economy, with households, firms and government, AD is the sum total of consumption (C), investment (I) and government expenditure (G). With introduction of government sector, the new $\mathrm{AD}_{1}$ curve $(C+I+G)$ lies above the old AD curve $(C+I)$.
For simplicity, it is assumed that government expenditure is a constant amount. The new $\mathrm{AD}_{1}$ curve is parallel to old AD curve because at every level of output, the vertical distance between $(\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{I})$ curve and $(\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{I}+\mathrm{G})$ curve is the constant amount of government expenditure (G). Fig. 9.3 shows the effect of Government expenditure.
![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

Fig. 9.3
Let us now discuss the measures that can be taken by the government to correct the problems of excess and deficient demand in a three-sector economy.

It must be noted that inclusion of government sector in the aggregate demand will not change the nature or definition of excess and deficient demand discussed earlier in the chapter.

Remedy for Deficient Demand

The deficient demand can be corrected by increasing the aggregate demand by an amount equal to the deflationary gap.
In Fig. 9.4, F is the equilibrium attained when AD curve intersects the AS curve. But, point $F$ signifies the underemployment equilibrium and EG is the resultant deflationary gap. In order to correct this deflationary gap, government needs to use its fiscal measure of increasing expenditure.
When government expenditure is increased, the new level of aggregate demand is $\mathrm{AD}_{1}$ corresponding to a higher level of government expenditure. $\mathrm{AD}_{1}$ is sufficient to keep the economy at full employment equilibrium (point E).
![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)

Fig. 9.4

Remedy for Excess Demand 

To correct the problem of excess demand, the aggregate demand has to be reduced by an amount equal to inflationary gap.
In Fig. 9.5, F is the equilibrium attained when AD curve intersects the AS curve. In order to correct this inflationary gap, government needs to use its fiscal measure of reducing expenditure. Decrease in government expenditure will reduce aggregate demand and remove the inflationary gap.
When government expenditure is reduced by $\Delta G$, the $A D$ curve will shift downward to $A D_{1}$. The new level of aggregate demand is $\mathrm{AD}_{1}$ and it is sufficient to keep the economy at full employment equilibrium (point E).

CYCLICAL EFFECTS (TRADE CYCLE)

We know that the ideal situation for an economy is one in when $\mathrm{AD}=\mathrm{AS}$ corresponding to the level of full utilisation of all the available resources. However, in real life, AD fluctuates which brings changes in the levels of output, employment, income and price. These changes are generally cyclical in nature, i.e., these changes generally follow a cycle of four different stages, namely, boom, recession, depression and recovery (Fig. 9.6).
![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)

Fig. 9.6
Boom is the stage of increasing economic activities and there exists inflationary tendencies in this stage. After reaching its highest level, there comes some slackness in the economic activities and it is the Recession stage. If this stage is not controlled, then it tends to turn into the stage of Depression. In this stage, economic activities sink very low. Depression stage is also known as the 'gloom' or 'slump' phase of an economy. After touching its minimum point, there is a process of Recovery in the economy. This recovery brings the economy back to the stage of boom and, thus, the cycle is complete. The cycle of ups and downs continues to move in the economy as shown in the given diagram.

FISCAL POLICY

Fiscal policy refers to the policy of central government to control the situation of money supply in the economy. It is also known as 'Revenue and Expenditure Policy'. Government can influence the level of economic activities in a country through its fiscal policy. The main constituents or tools or instruments of Fiscal Policy are: (1) Expenditure Policy (Change in Government Spending); (2) Revenue Policy; (3) Public Borrowings; (4) Deficit Financing.

Fiscal Policy for Excess Demand

During excess demand, the Fiscal policy aims to reduce the level of aggregate demand through following measures:

1. Expenditure Policy (Decrease in Government Spending): Already discussed in Section 9.6.
2. Revenue Policy (Increase in Taxes): Already discussed in Section 9.6.

3. Public Borrowings (Increase in Borrowings): Government borrows money from public in the form of public deposits. During excess demand, government borrows money from the public to withdraw excess money held by them. It helps to reduce the money supply in the economy and, ultimately, aggregate demand falls.
4. Deficit Financing (Decrease): Deficit financing, i.e. printing of currency increases the supply of money in the economy. During excess demand, government avoids deficit financing to prevent increase of money supply.

Fiscal Policy for Deficient Demand 

During deficient demand, AD is less than AS corresponding to full employment level. So, the government follows an expansionary fiscal policy to raise the level of aggregate demand in the economy. The various instruments or measures used to control deficient demand are:

1. Expenditure Policy (Increase in Government Spending): Already discussed in Section 9.7.
2. Revenue Policy (Decrease in Taxes): Already discussed in Section 9.7.
3. Public Borrowings (Decrease in Borrowings): Public borrowings are reduced so as to provide additional purchasing power to the people.
4. Deficit Financing (Increase): The government aims to increase its level of expenditure through additional doses of deficit financing.
