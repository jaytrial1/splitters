10.1 INTRODUCTION

In the modern world, every government aims at maximising the welfare of its country. It requires a number of infrastructural, economic and welfare activities. All these activities require huge expenditure to be incurred. This requires appropriate planning and policy of the government. The solution to all these problems is 'Budget'. A budget is a document containing detailed programmes and policies of action for the given fiscal year.

10.2 MEANING OF GOVERNMENT BUDGET

Government budget is an annual statement, showing item wise estimates of receipts and expenditures during a Fiscal year. The receipts and expenditures, shown in the budget, are not the actual figures, but the estimated values for the coming fiscal year. Fiscal year is taken from $1^{\text {st }}$ April to $31^{\text {st }}$ March.

Important Points of Government Budget

- Budget is prepared by Government at all levels, i.e. Central Government, State Government and Local Government, which prepares its respective annual budget. However, we will restrict our studies to Budget of Central Government, known as 'Union Budget'.
- Estimated expenditures and receipts are planned as per the objectives of the government.
- In India, Budget is presented in the parliament on such a day, as the President may direct. By convention, Finance Minister presents the annual budget of the government on the first day of February each year.
- The Finance Minister reads out the 'Budget Speech' in the Lok Sabha. A copy of the Union Budget is laid in the Rajya Sabha soon after its presentation in the Lok Sabha.

- The Budget must be approved by the parliament, before it can come into effect on $1^{\text {st }}$ April, the start of India's Financial Year.
- The budget reveals the financial performance of the government in the last year and financial policies for the coming fiscal year.


10.3 OBJECTIVES OF GOVERNMENT BUDGET 

Government prepares the budget to fulfill certain objectives. These objectives are the direct outcome of government's economic, social and political policies. The various objectives of government budget are:

1. Reallocation of Resources (or Allocation Function): Through the budgetary policy, Government aims to reallocate resources in accordance with the economic (profit maximisation) and social (public welfare) priorities of the country. Government can influence allocation of resources through:
(i) Tax concessions or subsidies: To encourage investment, government can give tax concessions, subsidies etc., to the producers. For example, Government discourages the production of harmful consumption goods (like liquor, cigarettes etc.) through heavy taxes and encourages the use of 'Khadi products' by providing subsidies.
(ii) Directly producing goods and services: There are many non-profitable economic activities which are not undertaken by the private sector, like water supply, sanitation, law and order, national defence, etc. These are called 'Public Goods ${ }^{* *}$ '. Such activities are necessarily undertaken by the government in public interest \& to raise social welfare.

Public Goods** and Private Goods

1. Public Goods: Public goods are those goods or services that are collectively consumed. It is not possible to exclude anyone from enjoying their benefits and one person's consumption does not reduce the availability of others. The two main features of Public Goods are:

- Public Goods are non-rivalrous: The benefits of public goods are available to all and are not only restricted to one particular consumer. For example, if we consider a public park, the benefits of park will be available to all.
- Public Goods are Non-excludable: In case of public goods, there is no possible way to exclude anyone from enjoying the benefits of the good. Due to this reason, public goods are called nonexcludable. Even if some users do not pay, it is difficult to collect fees for the public good. These non-paying users are known as 'free-riders'.

2. Private Goods: Private goods are those goods or services whose benefits accrue to people who pay for them. For example, Chocolate purchased and consumed by a person will benefit that person only and not public at large.

Public Provision Vs Public Production

- Public provision refers to funding of public goods through the government budget, which can be used without any direct payment by the public.
- Public production relates to those goods which are directly produced by the government.

2. Reducing inequalities in income and wealth: Economic inequality is an inherent part of every economic system. Government aims to reduce such inequalities of income and wealth, through its budgetary policy. Government aims to influence distribution of income by imposing taxes on the rich and spending more on the welfare of the poor. It will reduce income of the rich and raise standard of living of the poor, thus reducing inequalities in the distribution of income.
Free LPG Connection (under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana) and food grains at a very nominal price to the Below Poverty Line (BPL) families by the government helps to raise quality of life of the BPL population.
3. Economic Stability: Economic Stability means the absence of large-scale fluctuation in prices. Such fluctuations create uncertainties in the economy. Government can exercise control over these fluctuations through taxes and expenditure.

- Inflationary tendencies emerge when aggregate demand is higher than the aggregate supply. Government can bring down aggregate demand by reducing its own expenditures.
- During deflation, government can increase its expenditure and give tax concessions and subsidies.
In short, policies of surplus budget during inflation and deficit budget during deflation helps to maintain stability of prices in the economy.

4. Management of Public Enterprises: There are large numbers of public sector industries (especially natural monopolies), which are established and managed for social welfare of the public. Budget is prepared with the objective of making various provisions for managing such enterprises and providing them financial help.

Natural Monopoly 

Natural monopoly exists when a single firm can produce goods and services at a cost which is lower than that of many competing firms. Government operates, manages and controls natural monopolies like railways, post offices, electricity, etc. to promote public welfare.
5. Economic Growth: Economic Growth implies a sustainable increase in the real GDP of an economy, i.e. an increase in volume of goods and services produced in an economy. Budget can be an effective tool to ensure the economic growth in a country.
(i) If the government provides tax rebates and other incentives for productive ventures and projects, it can stimulate savings and investments in an economy.
(ii) Spending on infrastructure of an economy enhances the production activity in different sectors of an economy. Government Expenditure is a major factor that generates demand for different types of goods and services in an economy which induces growth in private sector too.
However, before planning such expenditure, rebates and subsidies, Government should check the rate of inflation and tax rates. Also, there may be the risk of debt trap if loans are too high to finance the expenditure.

6. Reducing regional disparities: The government budget aims to reduce regional disparities through its taxation and expenditure policy, which encourages the setting up of production units in economically backward regions. For example, establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in the backward regions for promoting their economic development.
7. Employment Generation: Government Budget is used as an effective tool in the process of employment generation in various ways. Investment in infrastructural projects like construction of flyovers, bridges, expansion of roads, etc., creates jobs for different sections of the workforce. In rural / urban areas, government aims to provide jobs through various employment generation schemes like MGNREGA, SJSRY, PMRY, etc.

10.4 COMPONENTS OF BUDGET 

Components of budget refer to structure of the budget. Two main components of budget are:

1. Revenue Budget: It deals with the revenue aspect of the government budget. It explains how revenue is generated or collected by the government and how it is allocated among various expenditure heads. Revenue budget has two parts: (i) Revenue Receipts; (ii) Revenue Expenditures. In short, Revenue Budget is the statement of estimated revenue receipts and estimated revenue expenditure during a fiscal year.
2. Capital Budget: It deals with the capital aspect of the government budget and it consists of: (i) Capital Receipts; (ii) Capital Expenditures. In other words, Capital Budget is the statement of estimated capital receipts and estimated capital expenditure during a fiscal year.
For "Difference between Revenue Budget and Capital Budget", refer HOTS.
The Components of budget can also be categorised according to receipts and expenditures. On this basis, two broad components are: (1) Budget Receipts; (2) Budget Expenditures.

10.5 BUDGET RECEIPTS

Budget receipts refer to the estimated money receipts of the government from all sources during a given fiscal year. Budget receipts may be further classified as: (i) Revenue receipts; (ii) Capital receipts.
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

10.6 REVENUE RECEIPTS 

Revenue receipts refer to those receipts which neither create any liability nor cause any reduction in the assets of the government. They are regular and recurring in nature and government receives them in its normal course of activities.
A receipt is a revenue receipt, if it satisfies the following two essential conditions:
(i) The receipt must not create a liability for the government. For example, taxes levied by the government are revenue receipts as they do not create any liability. However, any amount borrowed by the government, is not a revenue receipt as it causes an increase in the liability in
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
terms of repayment of borrowings.
(ii) The receipt must not cause decrease in the assets. For example, receipts from the sale of shares of a public enterprise is not a revenue receipt as it leads to a reduction in assets of the government.

Two Sources of Revenue Receipts

Revenue receipts of the government are generally classified under two heads:
(i) Tax Revenue
(ii) Non-Tax Revenue

Tax Revenue

Tax revenue refers to the sum total of receipts from taxes and other duties imposed by the government. Tax is a unilateral (or one-sided) compulsory payment made by people and companies to the government without reference to any direct benefit in return. It means, there are two aspects of taxes:
(i) Tax is a compulsory payment, i.e., no one can refuse to pay it;
(ii) Tax receipts are spent by the government for common benefit of people in the country. A taxpayer cannot expect that the tax amount will be used for his direct benefit.

Tax revenue is the main source of regular receipts of the government. Government collects various kinds of taxes from public to meet its day-to-day expenditures and there is a strict action against anyone who fails to pay the taxes.
Tax Revenue can be further classified as:
(i) Direct Taxes
(ii) Indirect Taxes

Direct Taxes
Direct taxes refer to taxes that are imposed on property and income of individuals and companies and their burden cannot be shifted to the other person/entity.

- They are imposed on individuals and companies and their monetary burden is borne by those on whom they are levied.

- The 'liability to pay' the tax (i.e. impact) and 'actual burden' of the tax (i.e. incidence) lie on the same person, i.e. its burden cannot be shifted to others.

For example, in case of income tax, the liability to pay tax (i.e. impact) and 'actual burden' is on the same person on whom it is levied.

- They directly affect the income level and purchasing power of people and help to change the level of aggregate demand in the economy.
- Examples: Income Tax, Corporate Tax, Interest Tax, Property Tax, Wealth Tax**, Death Duty, Capital Gains Tax, etc.
Direct Tax Systems can be Progressive, Regressive or Proportional. For their detailed study, please refer Power Booster.


Indirect Taxes 

Indirect taxes are those taxes which can be shifted to another person/entity. Their monetary burden is ultimately borne by final users of goods and services, rather than the person on whom the tax is levied.

- They are imposed on goods and services.
- The 'liability to pay' the tax (i.e. impact) and 'actual burden' of the tax (i.e. incidence) lie on different persons, i.e. its burden can be shifted to others.

For example, in case of Goods and Services Tax (GST), the liability to pay tax to the government (i.e. impact) is on sellers. But, 'actual burden' (i.e. incidence) is on consumers because sellers collect the GST from them. So, burden of indirect taxes can be shifted.

- Examples: Goods and Services Tax (GST), Basic Customs Duty, Central Excise and VAT on Petroleum Products, Excise on Liquor, Electricity Duties, Stamp Duty, Securities Transaction Tax, Entertainment Tax, etc.
Following the 'One Nation One Tax' system, all Indirect Taxes (except the above mentioned indirect taxes) have been merged into single tax called as Goods and Services Tax (GST).
- Indirect Taxes can be avoided: Indirect taxes are compulsory payments. But, they can be avoided by not entering into those transactions, which call for such taxes. For example, consumers may save taxes by purchasing Khadi Gram Udyog items as there is no indirect tax on khadi items.


How to classify a Tax as Direct Tax or Indirect Tax?

- A tax is a direct tax, if its burden cannot be shifted. For example, income tax is a direct tax as its impact and incidence is on the same person.
- A tax is an indirect tax, if its burden can be shifted. For example, Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an indirect tax as its impact and incidence is on different persons.

Items categorised as Direct and Indirect Taxes

1. Corporation Tax
(CBSE, Foreign 2006, All India Comptt. 2016 (III))
It is a direct tax as its impact and incidence lie on the same person.
(Alternately, it is a direct tax as its liability to pay the tax (i.e. impact) and actual burden of the tax (i.e. incidence) lie on the same person.)
2. Goods and Services Tax

It is an indirect tax as its impact and incidence lie on different persons.
(Alternately, it is an indirect tax as its liability to pay the tax (i.e. impact) and actual burden of the tax (i.e. incidence) lie on two different persons, i.e. its burden can be shifted.)

It is a direct tax as its impact and incidence lie on the same person.
4. Capital Gains Tax
(CBSE, All India Comptt. 2016 (III))
It is a direct tax as its impact and incidence lie on the same person.
For "Classification of items as Direct and Indirect Taxes", refer HOTS.

Non-Tax Revenue 

Non-Tax revenue refers to receipts of the government from all sources other than those of tax receipts. The main sources of non-tax revenue are:

1. Interest: Government receives interest on loans given to state governments, union territories, private enterprises and general public. Interest receipts from these loans are an important source of non-tax revenue.
2. Profits and Dividends: Government earns profit through public sector undertakings like Indian railways, LIC, BHEL, etc. It earns profit from the sale proceeds of the products of such public enterprises. Government also gets dividends from its investments in other companies.
3. Fees: Fees refer to charges imposed by the government to cover the cost of recurring services it provides. Such services are generally in public interest and fees are paid by those, who receive such services. It is also a compulsory contributions like tax. Court fees, registration fees, import fees, etc., are some examples of fees.
4. License Fee: It is a payment charged by the government to grant permission for something. For example, a license fee is paid for permission to keep a gun or to obtain a National Permit for commercial vehicles.

5. Fines and Penalties: They refer to those payments which are imposed on law breakers. For example, fine for jumping red light or penalty for non-payment of tax. Fines are different from taxes as the former is levied to maintain law and order, whereas, the latter is imposed to generate revenue.
6. Escheats: It refers to claim of the government on the property of a person who dies without leaving behind any legal heir or a will.
7. Gifts and Grants: Government receives gifts and grants from foreign governments and international organisations. Sometimes, individuals and companies also voluntarily gift money to the government. Such gifts are not a fixed source of revenue and are generally received during national crises such as war, floods, etc.
8. Forfeitures: These are in the form of penalties which are imposed by the courts for noncompliance of orders or non-fulfilment of contracts etc.
9. Special Assessment: It refers to the payment made by owners of those properties whose value has been appreciated due to developmental activities of the government. For example, if value of a property near a Metro Station has increased, then a part of developmental expenditure is recovered from owners of such property in the form of special assessment.

Comparison between Tax Revenue and Non-Tax Revenue

| Basis | Tax Revenue | Non-Tax Revenue |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Meaning | Tax revenue refers to sum total of receipts from taxes and other duties imposed by the government. | Non-Tax revenue refers to receipts of the government from all sources other than those of tax receipts. |
| Nature | It is a compulsory payment imposed by the government. | It is not a compulsory payment. It becomes payable only when services offered by the government are availed. |
| Benefit | No direct benefit is received from the government in exchange of tax paid. | It is paid in exchange for services received. |
| Examples | Income Tax, Corporate Tax, Goods and Services Tax (GST), etc. | Interest, Profits and Dividends, Fees, etc. |

10.7 CAPITAL RECEIPTS 

Capital receipts refer to those receipts which either create a liability or cause a reduction in the assets of the government. They are non-recurring and non-routine in nature. A receipt is a capital receipt if it satisfies any one of the two conditions:
(i) The receipts must create a liability for the government. For example, Borrowings are capital receipts as they lead to an increase in the liability of the government. However, tax received is not a capital receipt as it does not result in creation of any liability.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
(ii) The receipts must cause a decrease in the assets. For example, receipts from sale of shares of public enterprise is a capital receipt as it leads to reduction in assets of the government.

Sources of Capital Receipts 

Capital receipts are broadly classified into three groups:

1. Borrowings: Borrowings are the funds raised by government to meet excess expenditure. Government borrow funds from: (i) Open Market (Public); (ii) Reserve Bank of India (RBI); (iii) Foreign governments (like loans from USA, England etc.); (iv) International institutions (like World Bank, International Monetary Fund). Borrowings are capital receipts as they create a liability for the government.
2. Recovery of Loans: Government grants various loans to state governments or union territories. Recovery of such loans is a capital receipt as it reduces the assets of the government.
3. Other Receipts: These include:
(a) Disinvestment: Disinvestment refers to the act of selling a part or the whole of shares of selected public sector undertakings (PSU) held by the government. They are termed as capital receipts as they reduce the assets of the government. Government holds ownership in various PSU's in the form of equity shares. When the government sells a part or whole of its shares, it leads to transfer of ownership of PSU's to the private enterprises.
(b) Small Savings: Small savings refer to funds raised from the public in the form of Post Office deposits, National Saving Certificates, Kisan Vikas Patras etc. They are treated as capital receipts as they lead to an increase in liability.

Debt Creating Vs Non-Debt Creating Capital Receipts

Capital Receipts can be classified as:

1. Debt Creating Capital Receipts: These are the capital receipts which create debts for the government. Net Borrowings by the Government (from any source) is an example of Debt Creating Capital Receipt.
2. Non-Debt Creating Capital Receipts: These are the capital receipts which do not create any debt or liability for the government. For example, Recovery of loans, disinvestments, etc.

Comparison between Revenue Receipts and Capital Receipts

| Basis | Revenue Receipts | Capital Receipts |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Meaning | They neither create any liability nor reduce any asset of the government. | They either create any liability or reduce any asset of the government. |
| Nature | They are regular and recurring in nature. | They are Irregular \&non-recurring in nature. |
| Future obligation | There is no future obligation to return the amount. | In case of certain capital receipts (like borrowings), there is future obligation to return the amount along with interest. |
| Examples | Tax Revenue (like Income tax, Goods and Services Tax, etc.) and Non-tax revenue (like interest, fees, etc.) | Borrowings, Disinvestment, etc. |

10.8 BUDGET EXPENDITURE 

Budget Expenditure refers to the estimated expenditure of the government during a given fiscal year.
(i) Revenue Expenditure
(ii) Capital Expenditure.

Revenue and Capital Expenditure 

Revenue Expenditure

Revenue expenditure refers to the expenditure which neither creates any asset nor causes reduction in any liability of the government. It is recurring in nature.

- It is incurred on normal functioning of the government \& the provisions for various services.
- Examples: Payment of salaries, pensions, interests, expenditure on administrative services, defence services, health services, grants to state, etc.
An expenditure is a revenue expenditure, if it satisfies the following two essential conditions:
(i) The expenditure must not create an asset of the government. For example, payment of salaries or pensions is revenue expenditure as it does not create any asset. However, the amount spent on construction of Metro is not a revenue expenditure as it leads to creation of an asset.
![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)
(ii) The expenditure must not cause decrease in any liability. For example, repayment of borrowings is not a revenue expenditure as it leads to reduction in liability of the government.

It must be noted that Union Grants to states are treated as revenue expenditure, even though some of the grants may be used for creation of assets.

Capital Expenditure

Capital expenditure refers to the expenditure which either creates an asset or causes a reduction in the liabilities of the government. It is non-recurring in nature.

- It adds to capital stock of the economy and increases its productivity through expenditure on long-term development programmes, like Metro or Flyover.
- Examples: Loans to States and Union Territories, expenditures on building roads, flyovers, factories, purchases of machinery, repayment of borrowings, etc.

An expenditure is a capital expenditure, if it satisfies any one of the following two conditions:
(i) The expenditure must create an asset for the government. For example, Construction of Metro is a capital expenditure as it leads to creation of an asset. However, any amount paid as salaries is not a capital expenditure as there is no increase
![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)
in the assets.
(ii) The expenditure must cause a decrease in the liabilities. For example, repayment of borrowings is a capital expenditure as it leads to a reduction in the liabilities of the government.

Payment of salary, interest or pension is not a capital expenditure as it neither creates an asset nor reduces any liability.

Comparison between Revenue Expenditure and Capital Expenditure

| Res | Revenue Expenditure | Capital Expenditure |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  |  |  |
| Meaning | Revenue expenditure neither creates any asset <br> nor reduces any liability of the government | Capital expenditure either creates an asset <br> or reduces a liability of the government. |
| Purpose | It is incurred for normal running of government <br> departments and provision of various services. | It is incurred mainly for acquisition of <br> assets and granting of loans and advances. |
| Nature | It is recurring in nature as such expenditure is <br> spent by government on day-to-day activities. | It is non-recurring in nature. |
| Examples | Salary, pension, Interest, etc. | Repayment of borrowings; Expenditure <br> on acquisition of capital asset, etc. |

10.9 BALANCED, SURPLUS AND DEFICIT BUDGET

The difference between total estimated government receipts and government expenditures may be zero. It may also be surplus or deficit, as the case may be. In this sense, there can be three types of budgets:

1. Balanced Budget: Government budget is said to be balanced if estimated government receipts are equal to the estimated government expenditure.
i.e. Balanced Budget: Estimated Government Receipts = Estimated Government Expenditure

- Balanced Budget shows financial stability in the country. It is an ideal situation but not practical at times of inflation or deflation.
- It indicates that government is not indulging in wasteful expenditure.

2. Surplus Budget: If estimated government receipts are more than the estimated government expenditure, then the budget is termed as 'Surplus Budget'.
i.e. Surplus Budget: Estimated Government Receipts > Estimated Government Expenditure

- In case of surplus budget, more money is being taken away by the Government than being injected in the economy. It helps to reduce the level of aggregate demand in the economy, which is required during excess demand to control inflation.
- However, during deflation, surplus budget further reduces the level of aggregate demand, which worsens the situation.
Deficit Budget: If estimated government receipts are less than the estimated government expenditure, then the budget is termed as 'Deficit Budget'.

i.e. Deficit Budget: Estimated Government Receipts < Estimated Government Expenditure

- Developing countries generally have deficit budget because they need to incur more expenditure than the amount of resources the economy can mobilize.
- It helps to increase the level of aggregate demand in the economy, which is required during deficient demand to control deflation.
- However, during excess demand, deficit budget would further increase the difference between $A D$ and $A S$ which would lead to inflationary gap.


10.10 MEASURES OF GOVERNMENT DEFICIT 

Budgetary deficit is defined as the excess of total estimated expenditure over total estimated revenue. When the government spends more than it collects, then it incurs a budgetary deficit.

Budgetary Deficit $=$ Total Expenditure - Total Receipts
With reference to the budget of Indian government, budgetary deficit can be of 3 types:
(i) Revenue Deficit
(ii) Fiscal Deficit
(iii) Primary Deficit
![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)

Revenue Deficit

Revenue deficit is concerned with the revenue expenditures \& revenue receipts of the government. It refers to excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts during the given fiscal year.

Revenue Deficit $=$ Revenue Expenditure - Revenue Receipts
Revenue deficit signifies that government's own revenue is insufficient to meet the expenditures on normal functioning of government departments and provisions for various services.

Implications of Revenue Deficit

- It indicates the inability of the government to meet its regular and recurring expenditure in the proposed budget.
- It implies that government is dissaving, i.e. government is using up savings of other sectors of the economy to finance its consumption expenditure.
- It also implies that the government has to make up this deficit from capital receipts, i.e. through borrowings or disinvestments. It means, revenue deficit either leads to an increase in liability in the form of borrowings or reduces the assets through disinvestment. - Use of capital receipts for meeting the extra consumption expenditure leads to an inflationary situation in the economy. Higher borrowings increase the future burden in terms of loan amount and interest payments and increase in such interest burden will lead to increase in revenue expenditure in future. This will result in further rise in revenue deficit.

- A high revenue deficit gives a warning signal to the government to either curtail its expenditure or increase its revenue.
According to far-sighted approach, revenue receipts should always be more than revenue expenditures so that surplus can be used for development projects. However, Indian Budget is facing revenue deficit for the past several years.


Measure to Reduce Revenue Deficit 

(i) Reduce Expenditure: Government should take serious steps to reduce its expenditure and avoid unproductive or unnecessary expenditure.
(ii) Increase Revenue: Government should increase its receipts from various sources of tax and non-tax revenue.

Fiscal Deficit

Fiscal deficit presents a more comprehensive view of budgetary imbalances. It is widely used as a budgetary tool for explaining and understanding the budgetary developments in India. Fiscal deficit refers to the excess of total expenditure over total receipts (excluding borrowings) during the given fiscal year.

Fiscal Deficit $=$ Total Expenditure - Total Receipts excluding borrowings**
The extent of fiscal deficit is an indication of how far the government is spending beyond its means.

**Total Receipts excluding borrowings includes

(i) Revenue Receipts
(ii) Capital Receipts excluding borrowings (or Non-debt creating capital receipts).

Non-debt creating capital receipts include all the capital receipts except the borrowings. So, such receipts do not give rise to debt. For example, recovery of loans or proceeds from disinvestment.

Implications of Fiscal Deficit

The implications of fiscal deficit are as follows:

1. Debt Trap: Fiscal deficit indicates the total borrowing requirements of the government. Borrowings not only involve repayment of principal amount, but also require payment of interest. Interest payments increase the revenue expenditure, which leads to revenue deficit. It creates a vicious circle of fiscal deficit and revenue deficit, wherein government takes more loans to repay the earlier loans. As a result, country is caught in a debt trap.
2. Inflation: Government mainly borrows from Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to meet its fiscal deficit. RBI prints new currency to meet the deficit requirements. It increases the money supply in the economy, which leads to increase in general price level and creates inflationary pressure.
3. Foreign Dependence: Government also borrows from rest of the world, which raises its dependence on other countries.
4. Hampers the future growth: Borrowings increase the financial burden for future generations. It adversely affects the future growth and development prospects of the country.

Fiscal Deficit gives borrowing requirements of the government. So, it must not be allowed to rise beyond manageable limits. The safe limit of fiscal deficit is considered to be 3\% of GDP. Greater fiscal deficit implies greater borrowings by the government. So, a high fiscal deficit is inherently bad for the health of an economy.

Ways to Calculate Fiscal Deficit 

Fiscal deficit can be calculated by any of the following methods:
(i) Fiscal Deficit = Total Expenditure - Total Receipts excluding borrowings
(ii) Fiscal Deficit = (Revenue Expenditure + Capital Expenditure) - (Revenue Receipts + Capital Receipts excluding Borrowings)

OR

Fiscal Deficit $=$ (Revenue Expenditure - Revenue Receipts) + (Capital Expenditure - Capital Receipts excluding Borrowings)

OR

Fiscal Deficit = Revenue Deficit + (Capital Expenditure - Capital Receipts excluding Borrowings)
At times, only the total borrowings are given. In such a case, Fiscal Deficit = Total Borrowings.
Comparison between Fiscal Deficit and Revenue Deficit

| Basis | Fiscal Deficit | Revenue Deficit |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Meaning | It shows the excess of total expenditure <br> over total receipts excluding borrowings. | It shows the excess of revenue expenditure <br> over the revenue receipts. |
| Indicator | It measures the total borrowing <br> requirements of the government. | It indicates inability of the government to <br> meet its regular \& recurring expenditure. |

Sources of Financing Fiscal Deficit

Government has to look out for different options to finance the fiscal deficit. The main two sources are:

1. Borrowings: Fiscal deficit can be met by borrowings from the internal sources (public, commercial banks etc.) or the external sources (foreign governments, international organisations etc.).
2. Deficit Financing (Printing of new currency): Government may borrow from RBI against its securities to meet the fiscal deficit. RBI issues new currency for this purpose. This process is known as deficit financing.
Borrowings are considered a better source as they do not increase the money supply, which is regarded as the main cause of inflation. On the other hand, deficit financing may lead to inflationary trends in the economy due to more money supply.

Primary Deficit

Primary deficit refers to difference between fiscal deficit of the current year and interest payments on the previous borrowings.

Primary Deficit = Fiscal Deficit - Interest Payments

The total borrowing requirement of the government includes the interest commitments on accumulated government to borrow in the current period.

Implications of Primary Deficit 

It indicates, how much of the government borrowings are going to meet expenses other than the interest payments. The difference between fiscal deficit and primary deficit shows the amount of interest payments on the borrowings made in the past. So, a low or zero primary deficit indicates that interest commitments (on earlier loans) have forced the government to borrow.

What happens when Primary Deficit $=0$

We know: Primary Deficit = Fiscal Deficit - Interest Payments
If Primary Deficit is zero, then
$0=$ Fiscal Deficit - Interest Payments
$\Rightarrow$ Fiscal Deficit $=$ Interest Payments
It means, that the government has to borrow only on account of interest payments.

Primary Deficit is the root Cause of Fiscal Deficit

In India, interest payments have considerably increased in the recent years. High interest payments on past borrowings have greatly increased the fiscal deficit. To reduce the fiscal deficit, interest payments should be reduced through repayment of loans as early as possible.

KINDS OF DIRECT TAX SYSTEMS

There can be three types of direct tax systems according to the relationship between its rate structure and income, wealth or economic power of the taxpayer:
(i) Proportional Tax System: It is a system in which the tax rate remains constant with increase or decrease in the income.
Example: If tax rate is $10 \%$ and the annual income of a person is $₹ 1,00,000$, then he will have to pay ₹ 10,000 per year as tax. If income rises to ₹ 1,25,000 per annum, then the tax liability will rise to ₹ 12,500 per year. In this case, burden of tax is more on the poor section as compared to rich section.
(ii) Progressive Tax system: It is a system in which the tax rate increases with an increase in the level of income of tax payers.
Example: Tax rate of $10 \%$ for persons earning between ₹ 60,000 and ₹ 1,00,000 per annum and $20 \%$ for persons earning between $₹ 1,00,000$ and $₹ 1,50,000$ per annum. In this case, burden of tax is more on rich section as compared to poor section. India follows the progressive tax system.
(iii) Regressive Tax System: It is a system in which the rate of tax decreases with an increase in the income of taxpayers.
Example: If a person pays ₹ 1,000 as tax on income of ₹ 10,000 , then tax rate is $10 \%$. If his income rises to ₹ 15,000 and he is required to pay ₹ 1,200 as tax, then the average tax rate will fall to $8 \%$. In this case, burden of tax is more on the poor section as compared to rich section.

PLAN AND NON-PLAN EXPENDITURE

Budget Expenditure can also be classified as Plan and Non-Plan Expenditure.

1. Plan Expenditure: Plan Expenditure refers to the expenditure that is incurred on the programmes detailed in the current five year plan. For example, expenditure on agriculture and allied activities, irrigation, energy, transport, communication, general economic and social services etc. Plan expenditure shows the expenditure to be incurred on: (i) Projects covered under the Central Plans, and (ii) Central Assistance for State and Union Territory.
2. Non-Plan Expenditure: Non-Plan Expenditure refers to the expenditure other than the expenditure related to the current five-year plan. For example, payment of interest, expenditure on defence services, subsidies, expenditure to be incurred on administrative services, etc. It is incurred on routine functioning of the government. Therefore, it is a must for every country.
Plan Expenditure Vs Non-Plan Expenditure
(i) Plan expenditure is spent on current development and investment outlays, whereas, non-plan expenditure is spent on the routine functioning of the government.

(ii) Plan expenditure arises only when the plans provide for such expenditure, but non-plan expenditure is a must for every economy and the government cannot escape from it.

How to classify an expenditure as Plan or Non-Plan Expenditure? 

- An expenditure is a plan expenditure, if it arises due to planned proposals.
- An expenditure is a non-plan expenditure, if it is out of the scope of government plans.


DEVELOPMENTAL AND NON-DEVELOPMENTAL EXPENDITURE

Budget Expenditure can also be classified as Developmental and Non-Developmental Expenditure.

1. Developmental Expenditure: Developmental expenditure refers to the expenditure which is directly related to economic and social development of the country. For example, expenditure on agricultural and industrial development, education, health, social welfare, scientific research, etc. Expenditure on such services is not a part of the essential functioning of the government. Developmental expenditure adds to the flow of goods and services in the economy.
2. Non-Developmental Expenditure: Non-Developmental Expenditure refers to the expenditure which is incurred on the essential general services of the government. For example, expenditures on defence, administrative services, police, justice, etc. It does not directly contribute to economic development, but it indirectly helps in the development of the economy. Such expenditure is essential from the administrative point of view.

Developmental Expenditure Vs Non-Developmental Expenditure

(i) Developmental expenditure directly contributes to development of the economy, whereas, non-developmental expenditure does not contribute directly to the development, but it lubricates the wheels of economic development;
(ii) Developmental expenditure is productive in nature as it adds to the flow of goods and services, whereas, non developmental expenditure is not concerned with the productivity of working class.

How to classify an expenditure as Developmental and Non-Developmental Expenditure?

- An expenditure is a developmental expenditure, if it directly adds to the flow of goods and services
- An expenditure is a non-developmental expenditure, if it indirectly contributes to economic development.
