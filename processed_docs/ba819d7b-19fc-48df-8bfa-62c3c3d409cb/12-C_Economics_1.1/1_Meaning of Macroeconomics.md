1_Meaning of Macroeconomics

# MEANING OF MACROECONOMICS

The term 'macro' has been derived from the Greek word 'makros' which means 'large'. So, macroeconomics deals with the overall performance of the economy. It is concerned with the study of problems of the economy like inflation, unemployment, poverty, etc. The emergence of Macroeconomics as a separate branch can be traced back to 1936, when the British Economist Lord J. M. Keynes published his book, 'The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money'. Macroeconomics is that part of economic theory which studies the behaviour of aggregates of the economy as a whole. For example, National income, aggregate output, aggregate consumption, etc. Its main tools are Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply.

# Need for a Separate Theory of Macroeconomics

Microeconomics failed to study the aggregates of the economy as a whole. As a result, there was a need for a separate theory, which could explain the working of the economy. Macroeconomics helps to understand the working of an economic system as well as to explain the various macroeconomic paradoxes.
