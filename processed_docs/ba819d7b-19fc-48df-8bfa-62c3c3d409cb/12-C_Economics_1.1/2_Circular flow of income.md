2_Circular flow of income

# 1.2 CIRCULAR FLOW OF INCOME

## Introduction

The unlimited and recurring wants of human beings have made the production process a continuous process. In this process, different factors of production (Land, Labour, Capital, and Enterprise) are combined together for the production of goods and services.

- Firms produce goods and services with the collective efforts of factors of production supplied by the household sector.
- Firms make payments to the factors of production in the form of rent, wages, interest, and profit (known as factor incomes).
- The household sector spends this money on the purchase of goods and services produced by the firms.

Thus, income flows first from firms to households in the form of factor payments and then, from households to firms in the form of consumption expenditure. Such a flow of money is known as the circular flow of income.

## Meaning of Circular Flow of Income

It refers to the cycle of generation of income in the production process, its distribution among the factors of production and finally, its circulation from households to firms in the form of consumption expenditure on goods and services produced by them.

## Phases of Circular Flow of Income

There are 3 different phases (generation, distribution, and disposition) in the circular flow of income, as shown in the given diagram:

### 1. Generation Phase

In this phase, firms produce goods and services with the help of factor services.

Fig. 1.1

### 2. Distribution Phase

This phase involves the flow of factor income (rent, wages, interest, and profit) from firms to the households.

### 3. Disposition Phase

In this phase, the income received by factors of production is spent on the goods and services produced by firms.
In this way, income generated in production units returns to production units & completes the circular flow.

# 1.3 STOCK AND FLOW

The concepts of stock and flow are used frequently in macroeconomics. Some of the macro variables relate to stock, while others relate to flow. Therefore, it is important to understand their meaning so that variables can be categorised as stock or flow.

## Stock

A stock variable refers to that variable which is measured at a particular point in time. For example, the stock of goods in the godown as on $31^{\text {st }}$ January, 2025. It means, stock variables are not time dimensional. Some more examples of stock variables are national wealth, national capital, money supply, etc.

## Flow

A flow variable refers to that variable which is measured over a period of time. For example, the production of goods during the month of January 2025, the birth rate in the year 2024, and National Income in the year 2024 are flow variables. The 'period of time' could be a day, a week, a year, etc. It means flow variables are time dimensional as they are measured for a period of time.

## Examples for Better Clarity

- The amount of water in a tank is the quantity of water in the tank at a given point in time. On the other hand, water flowing from the tank through a tap is a flow of water being added to the tank per unit of time.
- The total number of houses as on $31^{\text {st }}$ December, 2024 is the stock concept, while the number of houses constructed during 2024 is a flow variable.

## Mutual Dependence between Stock and Flow

Both stock and flow impact each other. For example, an increase in the flow of water into a tank increases the stock of water in the tank. Similarly, the flow of water out of the tank depends on the stock of water in the tank. Thus, there is a mutual dependence between stock and flow.

## Difference between Stock and Flow

# 1.4 TYPES OF CIRCULAR FLOW

There are two types of circular flows: (i) Real flow; (ii) Money Flow.

## Real Flow

Real flow refers to the flow of factor services from households to firms and the corresponding flow of goods and services from firms to households.
As seen in the diagram, households provide factor services to the firms which, in turn, provide goods and services to them as a reward for their productive services.

- It is also known as 'Physical flow'.
- There is only an exchange of goods and services between the two sectors without the involvement of any money.
- Real flow determines the magnitude of the growth process in an economy. For example, when more factor services are offered to firms, then the volume of production will be more and it speeds up the process of economic growth.

## Money Flow

Money Flow refers to the flow of factor payments from firms to households for their factor services and the corresponding flow of consumption expenditure from households to firms for the purchase of goods and services produced by the firms.

As seen in the diagram, firms make factor payments to households for their factor services and households spend this income on the purchase of goods and services produced by the firms.

- It is also known as 'Nominal flow'.
- It involves an exchange of money between the two sectors.

## Four Sectors of the Economy

The four major sectors in an economy according to the macroeconomic point of view are:

### 1. Household Sector

It includes consumers of goods and services and the owners of factors of production. They supply factors like land, labour, capital, and entrepreneur and receive income in return in the form of rent, wages, interest, and profit respectively.

### 2. Producing Sector (Firms)

It includes all producing firms in the economy. To produce goods and services, the firm hires factors of production from the households.
Households consume goods and services to satisfy their wants and firms produce goods and services to make a profit.

### 3. Government Sector

It acts in two capacities:

As a welfare agency, it is involved in maintaining law and order, defence, and other services of public welfare.

- As a producer, it produces goods and services in public sector enterprises.

### 4. Foreign Sector (or External Sector or Rest of the World Sector)

This sector includes transactions with the rest of the world. It is involved in the export and import of goods and the flow of capital between the domestic economy and other countries of the world.

# 1.5 CIRCULAR FLOW IN A SIMPLE ECONOMY (TWO-SECTOR ECONOMY)

A simple economy assumes the existence of only two sectors, i.e., the household sector & firm sector.

- Households are the owners of factors of production and consumers of goods and services.
- Firms produce goods and services and sell them to the households.

It is the simplest form of a closed economy**, in which there is no government sector and foreign sector.

## Closed Economy and Open Economy

A closed economy is an economy which has no economic relations with the rest of the world. However, in the current scenario, there is hardly any country which does not have any economic relations with other nations. A closed economy has 3 sectors: Household Sector, Producing Sector, and Government Sector, i.e., it does not have any Foreign Sector.
An open economy is an economy which has economic relations with the rest of the world. In the current scenario, all the nations have economic relations with other nations. An open economy has 4 sectors: Household Sector, Producing Sector, Government Sector, and Foreign Sector.

In order to make our analysis simple, we take some assumptions:

1. There are only 2 sectors in the economy: Households and Firms. It means, there is no government and foreign sector.
![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

2. The household sector supplies factor services only to firms and the firms hire factor services only from households.
3. Firms produce goods and services and sell their entire output to the households.
4. Households receive factor income for their services and spend the entire amount on consumption of goods and services.
5. There are no savings in the economy, i.e., neither the households save from their incomes, nor the firms save from their profits.

The Circular flow in a Two-Sector economy can be better understood with the help of Fig. 1.4.

- The outer loop of the diagram shows the real flow, i.e., the flow of factor services from households to firms and the corresponding flow of goods and services from firms to households.
- The inner loop shows the money flow, i.e., the flow of factor payments from firms to households and the corresponding flow of consumption expenditure from households to firms.
![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

Fig. 1.4

It must be noted that the entire amount of money which is paid by firms as factor payments is paid back by the factor owners to the firms. So, there is a circular and continuous flow of money income.

In the circular flow of income, production generates factor income, which is converted into expenditure. This flow of income continues as production is a continuous activity due to never-ending human wants. It makes the flow of income circular.

## Conclusions of Circular Flow in a Simple Economy

In a Two-Sector Economy, the following Conclusions can be drawn:
(i) Total Production of goods and services by Firms = Total Consumption of goods and services by Households.
(ii) Factor Payments by firms = Factor Incomes of households.
(iii) Consumption Expenditure by households = Factor Income of households.
(iv) Real Flow in the form of factor services and final goods and services = Money Flow between firms and households.

# 1. CIRCULAR FLOW IN A TWO-SECTOR ECONOMY (WITH FINANCIAL MARKET)

Circular Flow in a two-sector economy without the financial market assumed that there are no savings, i.e., households spend their entire income on purchase of goods and services and firms spend all the receipts from the sale of goods and services in making factor payments.
But, in actual practice, households do not spend their entire income on consumption, i.e., a part of their income is saved. Similarly, firms also save some part of their receipts for expansion or other reasons. Firms also borrow money to finance their expansion programmes. All savings and borrowings are channelised through a financial market. A financial market refers to institutions such as banks, insurance companies etc., which transact in loanable funds. Savings of households accumulated in the financial market are utilised by firms for investment purposes. So, the circular flow of income continues as shown in the following diagram:
![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)

Fig. 1.5

# 2. CIRCULAR FLOW IN A THREE-SECTOR ECONOMY

Circular flow of income in a three-sector economy consists of households, firms, and the government sector. The government plays a very important role in the economic development of a country. It acts as both a consumer and a firm. As a consumer, it spends on consumption of goods and services produced by firms. As a producer, it produces goods and services for the economy. In addition to flows of circular flow in a two-sector economy with a financial market, the introduction of Government leads to the following flows:

- Between Households and Government: Money flows from government to households in the form of: (i) Transfer payments like scholarships, old age pensions, etc.; and (ii) Factor payments for hiring factor services of households.

Money flows back to the government from households in the form of direct taxes like income tax, interest tax, etc.

- Between Firms and Government: Money flows from firms in the form of direct taxes and indirect taxes.
Money flows to the firms from the government when the latter grants subsidies and makes payments to the former for the purchase of goods and services produced by the firms.

A part of the income earned by the government is also saved and deposited in the financial market. The government also borrows money from the financial market to meet its expenditure. A brief summary of this circular flow is given in the following diagram:
![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

Fig. 1.6

# 3. ROLE OF GOVERNMENT SECTOR IN AN ECONOMY

The Government Sector performs the following activities in the economy:
(a) Government collects taxes from households and firms.
(b) Government makes transfer payments to the households and provides subsidies to the firms.
(c) Government makes the payment for the purchase of goods and services from the firms.
(d) Government saves and borrows money with the help of the financial market.

# 4. CIRCULAR FLOW IN A FOUR-SECTOR ECONOMY

Circular flow of income in a four-sector economy consists of households, firms, government, and the foreign sector. The various money flows in each sector are:

- Household Sector: Households provide factor services to firms, government, and the foreign sector. In return, it receives factor payments. Households also receive transfer payments from the government and the foreign sector. Households spend their income on: (i) Payment for goods and services purchased from firms; (ii) Tax payments to the government; (iii) Payments for imports.

- Firms: Firms receive revenue from households, government, and the foreign sector for the sale of their goods and services. Firms also receive subsidies from the government. Firms make payments for: (i) Factor services to households; (ii) Taxes to the government; (iii) Imports to the foreign sector.
- Government: Government receives revenue from firms, households, and the foreign sector for the sale of goods and services, taxes, fees, etc. Government makes factor payments to households and also spends money on transfer payments and subsidies.
- Foreign Sector: The foreign sector receives revenue from firms, households, and government for export of goods and services. It makes payments for the import of goods and services from firms and the government. It also makes payment for the factor services to the households. The savings of households, firms, and the government sector get accumulated in the financial market. The financial market invests money by lending out money to households, firms, and the government. The inflows of money in the financial market are equal to the outflows of money. It makes the circular flow of income complete and continuous. The circular flow of income in a four-sector economy is shown in Fig. 1.7.

# 5. SIGNIFICANCE OF CIRCULAR FLOW OF INCOME

The study of circular flow of income is important due to the following reasons:

1. It helps us to understand the mutual interdependence among different sectors of the economy namely the household sector, producer sector, government sector, and foreign sector. It shows that all the sectors are complementary to one another in such a way that the economic activity remains intact.

2. It shows the equilibrium position of the economy. If there is any distortion in the circular flow, the economy will be in disequilibrium and the smooth functioning of the economy will be disturbed.
3. It helps in identifying various types of leakages and injections in the economy.
4. It helps in the estimation of national income. The circular flow shows the three phases of flow of income (generation, distribution, and disposition). It facilitates the determination of three different ways (production, income, and expenditure methods) in which the flow of income can be measured.

# 6. LEAKAGES AND INJECTIONS

## Leakages

Leakages refer to the withdrawal of money from the circular flow. When households and firms save a part of their incomes, it leads to a leakage from the circular flow of income. Leakage or withdrawal refers to that part of income which does not pass through the circular flow of income. As a result, it is not available for spending on currently produced goods and services. It means leakages reduce the flow of Income.

### Examples of Leakages in different types of Economies

1. Two-sector economy (without Financial Market) »» No Leakage
2. Two-sector economy (with Financial Market) »» Savings
3. Three-sector economy »» Savings + Taxes
4. Four-sector economy »» Savings + Taxes + Imports

## Injections

Injection refers to the introduction of income into the circular flow. When households and firms borrow money from external sources like financial institutions, it adds to their income. Such additional income does not result in immediate expenditure. So, injections increase the flow of income.

### Examples of Injections in different types of Economies

1. Two-sector economy (without Financial Market) »» No Injection
2. Two-sector economy (with Financial Market) »» Investment
3. Three-sector economy »» Investment + Govt. Exp.
4. Four-sector economy »» Investment + Govt. Exp. + Exports

It must be noted that Equilibrium is achieved when injections are equal to Leakages.
