7.1 MEANING AND COMPONENTS OF AGGREGATE DEMAND

Aggregate Demand (AD) refers to the total value of final goods and services that all the sectors of an economy plan to buy at a given level of income during a period of one accounting year. In other words, AD is the aggregate expenditure that different sectors of the economy are willing to incur during a given period. It means, AD and aggregate expenditure mean the same.
It is important to note that aggregate expenditure refers to the planned expenditure and not the actual expenditure. So, AD is the total expenditure that all households, firms, government and the rest of the world are planning to incur during a given period of time. AD is a flow concept as it is generally measured for the period of an accounting year.

Do not confuse Aggregate Demand with Market Demand: Aggregate demand is the total demand for all goods and services in the entire economy, whereas, market demand is the total demand for one commodity in the market.

Components of Aggregate Demand

The various components of Aggregate demand are:

1. Private (Household) Consumption Expenditure (C): It refers to the total expenditure incurred by households on purchase of goods and services during an accounting year. Generally, consumption expenditure is directly influenced by the level of 'Disposable Income', i.e., higher the disposable income, more is the consumption expenditure and vice-versa.

Disposable Income refers to the income from all sources, which is available to households for spending on consumption and saving.
It must be kept in mind that the consumption expenditure we are discussing is ex-ante, i.e. planning consumption expenditure.
2. Investment Expenditure (I): It refers to the total expenditure incurred by all private firms on capital goods. It includes addition to the stock of physical capital assets such as machinery, equipment, buildings, etc. and change in inventory.
For simplicity, it is assumed in our study that 'Investment Expenditure' is autonomous, i.e. investments are not influenced by level of income.
3. Government Expenditure (G): It refers to the total expenditure incurred by government on consumer goods and capital goods to satisfy the common needs of the economy. It means, government incurs consumption expenditure as well as investment expenditure.

- Consumption expenditure is incurred to meet public needs like law and order, education, health, transport, defence, etc.
- Investment expenditure involves construction of highways, roads, power plants, etc. Level of Government Expenditure is determined by the policy of government, which is generally guided by social welfare.

4. Net Exports ( $X-M$ ): Exports indicate demand for goods produced within the domestic territory of a country by the rest of the world. Imports refer to demands of the residents of a country for the goods that have been produced abroad. The difference between exports and imports is termed as net exports.
The magnitude of net exports generally depends on rate of exchange, relative prices of goods, exchange duties, trade policy, etc.

COMPONENTS OR DETERMINANTS OR CONSTITUENTS OF AD 

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Aggregate Demand in a Two-Sector Model (AD = C + I)
Since the determination of income and employment is to be studied in the context of the two-sector model (households and firms), the third and fourth components of aggregate demand are not discussed in detail. So, even though AD has four components, we will assume that there is closed economy and $A D$ is a function of only consumption expenditure and investment Expenditure, i.e. $A D=C+I$.

Diagrammatic Representation of AD

AD depends upon the level of income in the economy. Generally, there exists a positive relationship between income and the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy, i.e., as

the level of income rises, AD also rises and vice-versa. Let us understand this with the help of Table 7.1 and Fig. 7.1:
Table 7.1: Aggregate Demand Schedule

Amount in ₹ crores

| Income <br> (Y) | Consumption <br> (C) | Investment <br> (I) | AD <br> (C + I) |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 0 | 40 | 20 | 60 |
| 100 | 120 | 20 | 140 |
| 200 | 200 | 20 | 220 |
| 300 | 280 | 20 | 300 |
| 400 | 360 | 20 | 380 |
| 500 | 440 | 20 | 460 |
| 600 | 520 | 20 | 540 |

Table 7.1 and Fig. 7.1 reveal following noteworthy points about AD:

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Fig. 7.1

Important Points about AD 

1. $\mathrm{AD}=\mathrm{C}+1$ : As stated before, AD is assumed to be a function of only consumption demand and investment demand.
2. Positive consumption, even when income level is zero: There is always some minimum level of consumption, even when the income is zero. It happens because people need certain basic goods and services to sustain themselves, even if income is zero.
In Table 7.1, consumption of ₹ 40 crores (when $\mathrm{Y}=0$ ), is termed as autonomous consumption (c). In Fig. 7.1, consumption curve starts from point $S$ and not from origin. The positive consumption at zero level of income (i.e. OS) indicates level of autonomous consumption (c).

Autonomous Consumption denoted by '(c)' refers to minimum level of consumption, which is needed for survival, i.e. consumption at zero level of national income. Such consumption is met either from past savings or through sale of assets or borrowings.
3. Slope of Consumption Curve: The first component of AD, i.e. Consumption Curve, slopes upwards because consumption increases with increase in income. However, proportionate increase in consumption is less than that of income. It happens because after reaching a particular level, people start saving a part of their income.
4. Slope of Autonomous Investment Curve: The second component, investment expenditure (I), is a straight line parallel to the $X$-axis as it is assumed to be independent of the level of income. As seen in Table 7.1, investment remains constant at ₹ 20 crores. In Fig. 7.1, OR indicates the level of autonomous investment.
5. Starting point of AD curve or $\mathrm{C}+$ I curve: AD curve starts from point T , as at zero level of national income, AD = Autonomous Consumption (OS) + Autonomous Investment (OR). In Table 7.1, AD is ₹ 60 crores at zero level of income.
6. Slope of AD curve: AD curve has a positive slope which indicates that as income increases, AD or aggregate expenditure also increases.

7.2 AGGREGATE SUPPLY 

Aggregate Supply (AS) refers to the money value of final goods and services that all the producers willing to supply in an economy in a given time period. It must be noted that AS refers only to 'Pls in Production' or 'Desired Output' during a given time period. It does not refer to actual output

Aggregate Supply = National Income

When AS is expressed in physical terms, it refers to the total output of goods and services an economy. We know that value of total output is distributed to factors of production in the form of rent, wages, interest and profit. The sum total of these factor incomes (i.e. rent + wages + interest + profit) at domestic and national level is termed as National Income. So, we can say that aggregate supply (AS) and national income (Y), are one and the same thing.

Components of Aggregate Supply (AS) or National Income (Y)

The major portion of national income is spent on consumption of goods and services and the balance is saved. It means, Income (Y) is either consumed or saved.
So, National Income (Y) = Consumption (C) + Saving (S)
Or, $\quad \mathrm{Y}=\mathrm{AS}=\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{S}$

Diagrammatic Representation of AS

The aggregate supply curve and national income curve coincide with each other. The nature of National Income curve or AS curve can be made clear with the help of Table 7.2 and Fig. 7.2

Table 7.2: Aggregate Demand Schedule

|  | Amount in ₹crores |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Income <br> (Y) | Consumption <br> (C) | Saving <br> (S) | AS <br> (C+S) |
| 0 | 40 | $-40$ | 0 |
| 100 | 120 | $-20$ | 100 |
| 200 | 200 | 0 | 200 |
| 300 | 280 | 20 | 300 |
| 400 | 360 | 40 | 400 |
| 500 | 440 | 60 | 500 |
| 600 | 520 | 80 | 600 |

In Fig. 7.2, income is represented on the X -axis and consumption and saving are measured on the Y-axis. A $45^{\circ}$ line, which represents the aggregate supply, has been drawn from the origin. The line is drawn by taking the same scale on both the axes. At every point on this $45^{\circ}$ line, $\mathrm{Y}=\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{S}$.

7.3 CONSUMPTION FUNCTION (PROPENSITY TO CONSUME) 

Consumption expenditure refers to that portion of income which is spent on the purchase of goods and services at the given level of income. Consumption function refers to functional relationship between consumption and national income.

$$
C=f(Y)
$$

Where, $C=$ Consumption; $Y=$ National Income; $f=$ Functional relationship

- Consumption function represents the willingness of households to purchase goods and services at a given level of income during a given time period.
- It also shows the consumption level at different levels of income in an economy.
- It is a psychological concept as it is influenced by subjective factors, like consumers' preferences, habits, etc.
The relationship between consumption and income is shown in Table 7.3 and Fig. 7.3.
Table 7.3: Consumption Schedule

| Income (Y) <br> (c) Crores) | Consumption (c) <br> (c) Crores) |
| :--: | :--: |
| 0 | 40 |
| 100 | 120 |
| 200 | 200 |
| 300 | 280 |
| 400 | 360 |
| 500 | 440 |
| 600 | 520 |

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

Fig. 7.3
In Fig. 7.3, National Income is measured on X-axis and consumption expenditure on the Y-axis. Important Observations from Table 7.3 and Fig. 7.3.

1. Starting Point of Consumption Curve: Consumption curve (CC) starts from point C on the Y-axis. This implies that there is autonomous consumption (c) of OC even when the national income is zero.
2. Slope of Consumption Curve: CC has a positive slope, which indicates that as income increases, consumption also rises. However, proportionate rise in consumption is less than proportionate rise in income as part of income is saved.
3. Income is less than Consumption: When income is less than consumption (i.e., at income levels less than OM in Fig. 7.3 and less than ₹ 200 crores in Table 7.3), the gap is covered by dissaving (i.e., by utilising previous saving) $\Delta \mathrm{COE}$ represents dissaving.
4. Break-even point ( $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{Y}$ ): At OM level of income (as represented by point E ), consumption becomes equal to income and saving is zero. The point $E$ is known as the 'Break-even point'. In Table 7.3, break-even point occurs corresponding to income of $₹ 200$ crores.
Break-Even Point refers to the point at which consumption is equal to national income. At this point, saving is zero.

7.3 CONSUMPTION FUNCTION (PROPENSITY TO CONSUME) 

Consumption expenditure refers to that portion of income which is spent on the purchase of goods and services at the given level of income. Consumption function refers to functional relationship between consumption and national income.

$$
C=f(Y)
$$

Where, $C=$ Consumption; $Y=$ National Income; $f=$ Functional relationship

- Consumption function represents the willingness of households to purchase goods and services at a given level of income during a given time period.
- It also shows the consumption level at different levels of income in an economy.
- It is a psychological concept as it is influenced by subjective factors, like consumers' preferences, habits, etc.
The relationship between consumption and income is shown in Table 7.3 and Fig. 7.3.
Table 7.3: Consumption Schedule

| Income (Y) <br> (Cores) | Consumption (C) <br> (Cores) |
| :--: | :--: |
| 0 | 40 |
| 100 | 120 |
| 200 | 200 |
| 300 | 280 |
| 400 | 360 |
| 500 | 440 |
| 600 | 520 |

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

Fig. 7.3
In Fig. 7.3, National Income is measured on X-axis and consumption expenditure on the Y-axis. Important Observations from Table 7.3 and Fig. 7.3.

1. Starting Point of Consumption Curve: Consumption curve (CC) starts from point C on the Y-axis. This implies that there is autonomous consumption (c) of OC even when the national income is zero.
2. Slope of Consumption Curve: CC has a positive slope, which indicates that as income increases, consumption also rises. However, proportionate rise in consumption is less than proportionate rise in income as part of income is saved.
3. Income is less than Consumption: When income is less than consumption (i.e., at income levels less than OM in Fig. 7.3 and less than ₹ 200 crores in Table 7.3), the gap is covered by dissaving (i.e., by utilising previous saving) $\triangle \mathrm{COE}$ represents dissaving.
4. Break-even point ( $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{Y}$ ): At OM level of income (as represented by point E ), consumption becomes equal to income and saving is zero. The point $E$ is known as the 'Break-even point'. In Table 7.3, break-even point occurs corresponding to income of $₹ 200$ crores.
Break-Even Point refers to the point at which consumption is equal to national income. At this point, saving is zero.

5. Income is more than Consumption: At points to the right of point E, income is $n_{0}$ than consumption. Excess of income leads to saving. The gap between the $45^{\circ}$ line $_{0}$ is $n_{0}$ CC line after point E represents positive saving. $45^{\circ}$ line is significant as it indicates $n_{0}$ consumption spending is equal to, greater than, or less than the level of income.

Keynesian Psychological law of Consumption 

Consumption function is based on Keynes'famous Psychological Law of Consumption. This law states that:
(i) There is minimum consumption, known as autonomous consumption even at zero level of national income because survival needs consumption.
(ii) As the income increases, consumption also increases.
(iii) Income rises at a greater proportion as compared to increase in consumption.

Do not confuse Consumption with Consumption Function

Consumption refers to the amount of income which is spent on purchase of goods and services at the given level of income. On the other hand, consumption function refers to the schedule showing consumption expenditures at various levels of income.

7.4 TYPES OF PROPENSITIES TO CONSUME

There are two technical aspects of Propensity to consume:

1. Average Propensity to Consume (APC)
2. Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)

Average Propensity to Consume (APC)

Average propensity to consume refers to the ratio of consumption expenditure to the corresponding level of income.

$$
\mathrm{APC}=\frac{\text { Consumption (C) }}{\text { Income (Y) }}
$$

If consumption expenditure is $₹ 70$ crores at national income of $₹ 100$ crores, then:
$\mathrm{APC}=\frac{\mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{Y}}=\frac{70}{100}=0.70$, i.e. $70 \%$ of the income is spent on consumption.
Let us understand APC with the help of following schedule and diagram:
Table 7.4: Average Propensity to Consume

| Income (Y) <br> ( Crores) | Consumption (C) <br> ( Crores) | APC $=\frac{C}{Y}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 0 | 40 | - |
| 100 | 120 | $1.20\left(=\frac{120}{100}\right)$ |
| 200 | 200 | $1\left(=\frac{200}{200}\right)$ |
| 300 | 280 | $0.933\left(=\frac{280}{300}\right)$ |
| 400 | 360 | $0.90\left(=\frac{360}{400}\right)$ |

![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)

Fig. 7.4

5. Income is more than Consumption: At points to the right of point E, income is than consumption. Excess of income leads to saving. The gap between the $45^{\circ}$ line is significant as it indicates the consumption spending is equal to, greater than, or less than the level of income.

Keynesian Psychological law of Consumption 

Consumption function is based on Keynes'famous Psychological Law of Consumption. This law states that
(i) There is minimum consumption, known as autonomous consumption even at zero level of national income because survival needs consumption.
(ii) As the income increases, consumption also increases.
(iii) Income rises at a greater proportion as compared to increase in consumption.

Do not confuse Consumption with Consumption Function

Consumption refers to the amount of income which is spent on purchase of goods and service at the given level of income. On the other hand, consumption function refers to the schedule showing consumption expenditures at various levels of income.

7.4 TYPES OF PROPENSITIES TO CONSUME

There are two technical aspects of Propensity to consume:

1. Average Propensity to Consume (APC)
2. Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)

Average Propensity to Consume (APC)

Average propensity to consume refers to the ratio of consumption expenditure to the corresponding level of income.

$$
\mathrm{APC}=\frac{\text { Consumption (C) }}{\text { Income (Y) }}
$$

If consumption expenditure is $₹ 70$ crores at national income of $₹ 100$ crores, then:
$\mathrm{APC}=\frac{\mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{Y}}=\frac{70}{100}=0.70$, i.e. $70 \%$ of the income is spent on consumption.
Let us understand APC with the help of following schedule and diagram:
Table 7.4: Average Propensity to Consume

| Income (Y) <br> (₹ Crores) | Consumption (C) <br> (₹ Crores) | APC $=\frac{C}{Y}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 0 | 40 | - |
| 100 | 120 | $1.20\left(=\frac{120}{100}\right)$ |
| 200 | 200 | $1\left(=\frac{200}{200}\right)$ |
| 300 | 280 | $0.933\left(=\frac{280}{300}\right)$ |
| 400 | 360 | $0.90\left(=\frac{360}{400}\right)$ |

![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

Fig. 7.4

In Table 7.4, at the income level of ₹ 100 crores, APC $=1.20$. APC falls to 1 when income rises to $\boldsymbol{\$} 200$ crores. The value of APC further falls to 0.933 and then to 0.90 . In Fig 7.4, income is measured on the X -axis and consumption is measured on the Y -axis. CC is the consumption curve. APC represents any one point on the consumption curve. At point A on the consumption curve $C C, A P C=\frac{O N}{O Y_{1}}$

Important Points about APC 

(i) APC is more than 1: As long as consumption is more than national income, i.e. before the break-even point, APC $>1$.
(ii) APC = 1: At the Break-even point, consumption is equal to national income. So, APC $=1$ at the income level of ₹ 200 crores.
(iii) APC is less than 1: Beyond the break-even point, consumption is less than national income. As a result, APC $<1$.
(iv) APC falls with increase in income: APC falls continuously with increase in income because the proportion of income spent on consumption keeps on decreasing.
(v) APC can never be zero: APC can be zero only when consumption becomes zero. However, consumption is never zero at any level of income. Even at a zero level of national income, there is autonomous consumption (c).

Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)

Marginal propensity to consume refers to the ratio of change in consumption expenditure to change in total income. MPC explains what proportion of change in income is spent on consumption.

$$
\text { MPC }=\frac{\text { Change in Consumption }(\Delta \mathrm{C})}{\text { Change in Income }(\Delta \mathrm{Y})}
$$

If consumption expenditure increases from $\boldsymbol{\$} 70$ crores to $\boldsymbol{\$} 110$ crores with an increase in income from
$\$ 100$ crores to $\$ 200$ crores, then: MPC $=\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}=\frac{110-70}{200-100}=\frac{40}{100}=0.40$, i.e. $40 \%$ of incremental income is spent on consumption.
Let us understand MPC with the help of following schedule and diagram:
Table 7.5: Marginal Propensity to Consume

| Income <br> (Y) <br> (c) Crores) | Consumption <br> (C) <br> (c) Crores) | Change in <br> Consumption ( $\Delta \mathrm{C}$ ) <br> (c) Crores) | Change in <br> Income ( $\Delta \mathrm{Y}$ ) <br> (c) Crores) | MPC $=\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 0 | 40 | - | - | - |
| 100 | 120 | 80 | 100 | $0.80\left(=\frac{80}{100}\right)$ |
| 200 | 200 | 80 | 100 | $0.80\left(=\frac{80}{100}\right)$ |
| 300 | 280 | 80 | 100 | $0.80\left(=\frac{80}{100}\right)$ |
| 400 | 360 | 80 | 100 | $0.80\left(=\frac{80}{100}\right)$ |

As seen in Table 7.5, MPC is 0.80 , when consumption increases from ₹ 40 crores to ₹ 120 crores with increase in income from zero to ₹ 100 crores. Value of MPC remains same at 0.80 throughout the consumption function. Since MPC $\left(\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}\right)$ measures the slope of consumption curve, constant value of MPC indicates that the consumption curve is a straight line. In Fig. 7.5, MPC at point A with respect to point $B=\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}=\frac{M N}{Y_{1} Y_{2}}$
![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)

Fig. 7.5

Important Points about MPC 

1. Value of MPC varies between 0 and 1: We know, incremental income is either spent on consumption or saved for future use.

- If the entire additional income is consumed, i.e. $\Delta S=0$, then MPC $=1$.
- However, if entire additional income is saved, i.e. $\Delta C=0$, then MPC $=0$ In normal situations, value of MPC varies between 0 and 1.

2. MPC of poor is more than that of rich: It happens because poor people spend a great percentage of their increased income on consumption as most of their basic needs remale unsatisfied.
On the other hand, rich people spend a smaller proportion as they already enjoy a high standard of living. Similarly, the MPC of developing countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, etc. a higher than the MPC of developed countries like America or England.
3. MPC falls with successive increase in income: It happens because as an economy becuumt richer, it has the tendency to consume smaller percentage of each increment to its income and save more. Hence, at higher levels of income, people generally have lower MPC.

Slope of Consumption Curve: It is measured as the ratio between $\Delta C$ (additional consumption) and $\Delta Y$ (additional income) and this is known as MPC. Slope is always positive due to positive relationithd between consumption and income. In Table 7.5, MPC is constant at 0.80 . Due to constant MPC consumption curve (Fig. 7.5) is a straight line, i.e. Consumption Function is linear.

Comparison between APC and MPC

| Basis | APC | MPC |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Meaning | It is the ratio of consumption expenditure (C) to the corresponding level of income (Y) at a point of time. | It is the ratio of change in consumptile expenditure ( $\Delta \mathrm{C}$ ) to change in Incom ( $\Delta \mathrm{Y}$ ) over a period of time. |
| Value more than one | APC can be more than one as long as consumption is more than national income, i.e. till the break-even point. | MPC cannot be more than one as longan in consumption cannot be more than change in income. |

| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Formula | APC $=\frac{C}{Y}$ | MPC $=\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}$ |

Always Remember: Slope of Consumption Curve is Indicated by MPC and not by APC.

7.5 SAVING FUNCTION (PROPENSITY TO SAVE) 

Like consumption, saving is also a function of income, i.e., saving also depends upon the level of income. Saving is the excess of income over consumption expenditure. Saving function refers to the functional relationship between saving and national income.

$$
S=f(Y)
$$

Where, $S=$ Saving; $Y=$ National Income; $f=$ Functional relationship
'Saving Function' or 'Propensity to Save' shows the saving of households at a given level of income during a given time period. Alternately, the propensity to save shows the different levels of saving at different levels of income in an economy.
The relationship between saving and income is illustrated in Table 7.6 and Fig. 7.6:
Table 7.6: Saving Schedule

| income (Y) <br> ( $\$$ Crores) | Consumption (C) <br> ( $\$$ Crores) | Saving $(S=Y-C)$ <br> ( $\$$ Crores) |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 0 | 40 | -40 |
| 100 | 120 | -20 |
| 200 | 200 | 0 |
| 300 | 280 | 20 |
| 400 | 360 | 40 |
| 500 | 440 | 60 |
| 600 | 520 | 80 |

![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)

In Fig. 7.6, national income is measured on the $X$-axis and saving is measured on the $Y$-axis.

Important Observations from Saving Schedule and Saving Curve

1. Starting Point of Saving Curve: Saving curve (SS) starts from point $S$ on the $Y$-axis, indicating that there is negative saving (equal to amount of autonomous consumption) when national income is zero.

Note: The saving curve will have a negative intercept on $Y$-axis of the same magnitude as the consumption curve has positive intercept on the $Y$-axis. It happens because if consumption is positive at zero level of income, then there would be dissavings of the same magnitude.
2. Slope of Saving Curve: SS has a positive slope, which indicates the positive relationship between saving and income.

3. Break-even point ( $S=0$ ): Saving curve crosses the $X$-axis at point $R$, which is as break-even point as at this point, saving is zero (or consumption is equal to $\mathrm{in}_{\text {on }}$ ). According to Table 7.6, break-even point occurs corresponding to income of $\mathbb{P}_{200}$ or
4. Positive Saving: After the break-even point, saving is positive.

7.6 TYPES OF PROPENSITIES TO SAVE 

Propensities to save are of two types:

1. Average Propensity to Save (APS)
2. Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)

Average Propensity to Save (APS)

Average propensity to save refers to the ratio of saving to the corresponding level of income.

$$
\mathrm{APS}=\frac{\text { Saving }(\mathrm{S})}{\text { Income }(\mathrm{Y})}
$$

If saving is $₹ 30$ crores at national income of $₹ 100$ crores, then: $\mathrm{APS}=\frac{\mathrm{S}}{\mathrm{Y}}=\frac{30}{100}=0.30$, i.e. $30 \%$ of the of the income is saved.

The estimation of APS is illustrated with the help of Table 7.7 and Fig. 7.7.
Table 7.7: Average Propensity to Save

| Income (Y) <br> (₹ Crores) | Saving (S) <br> (₹ Crores) | APS $=\frac{S}{Y}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 0 | -40 | - |
| 100 | -20 | $-0.20\left(=\frac{-20}{100}\right)$ |
| 200 | 0 | $0\left(=\frac{0}{200}\right)$ |
| 300 | 20 | $0.067\left(=\frac{20}{300}\right)$ |
| 400 | 40 | $0.10\left(=\frac{40}{400}\right)$ |

![img-10.jpeg](img-10.jpeg)

Fig. 7.7

In Table 7.7, APS $=(-) 0.20$ at the income of $₹ 100$ crores as there is negative saving of $\mathbf{2} 20$ crores. APS $=0$ at income of $₹ 200$ crores as saving is zero. In Fig 7.7, income is measured ${ }^{20}$ the X -axis and saving is measured on the Y-axis. SS is the saving curve. APS at point $A{ }^{0}$ saving curve SS: APS $=\frac{\mathrm{OR}}{\mathrm{OY}_{1}}$.

Important Points about APS

1. APS can never be 1 or more than 1: As saving can never be equal to or more than natiool income.
2. APS can be 0: In Table 7.7, APS $=0$ as saving are zero at the income level of $₹ 200$ crores. This point is known as Break-even point.

3. APS can be negative or less than 1: At income levels which are lower than the break-
a yen point, APS can be negative as there will be dissavings in the economy (shown by the baded area in Fig. 7.7).
haded area in Fig. 7.7).
APS rises with increase in income: APS rises with increase in income because the proportion of income saved keeps on increasing.
Hinginal Propensity to Save (MPS)
Merginal propensity to save refers to the ratio of change in saving to change in total income.

$$
\text { MPS }=\frac{\text { Change in Saving }(\Delta S)}{\text { Change in Income }(\Delta Y)}
$$

If saving increases from $₹ 30$ crores to $₹ 90$ crores with an increase in income from $₹ 100$ crores to $₹ 200$ crores, then: MPS $=\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y}=\frac{90-30}{200-100}=\frac{60}{100}=0.60$, i.e. $60 \%$ of the incremental income is saved for future.
Let us understand MPS through following schedule and diagram:
Table 7.8: Marginal Propensity to Save

| income (Y) (₹ Crores) | Saving (S) (₹ Crores) | Change in Saving ( $\Delta S$ ) (₹ Crores) | Change in Income ( $\Delta Y$ ) (₹ Crores) | MPS $=\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 0 | $-40$ | - | - | - |
| 100 | $-20$ | 20 | 100 | $0.20=\frac{20}{100}$ |
| 200 | 0 | 20 | 100 | $0.20=\frac{20}{100}$ |
| 300 | 20 | 20 | 100 | $0.20=\frac{20}{100}$ |
| 400 | 40 | 20 | 100 | $0.20=\frac{20}{100}$ |

In Table 7.8, MPS $=0.20$ when income increases from zero to $₹ 100$ crores. Value of MPS remains constant at 0.20 throughout the saving function. Since MPS $\left(\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y}\right)$ measures the slope of saving curve, constant value of MPS means that the saving curve is a straight line. In Fig. 7.8, MPS at point A with respect to point $B=\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y}=\frac{P R}{Y_{1} Y_{2}}$
$\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{PS}}$ varies between 0 and 1
${ }^{\circ}$ If the entire additional income is saved, i.e. $\Delta C=0$ then
![img-11.jpeg](img-11.jpeg)

- However, if entire additional income is consumed, i.e. $\Delta S=0$, then MPS $=0$.

In normal situations, value of MPS varies between 0 and 1.
Slope of Saving Curve: It is measured as the ratio between $\Delta S$ (additional saving) and $\Delta Y$ (addition income) and this is known as MPS. Slope is always positive due to positive relationship between saving and income. In Table 7.8, MPS is constant at 0.20 . Due to constant MPS, saving curve (Fig. 7.4) is straight line, i.e. Saving Function is linear.

Comparison between APS and MPS

| Basis | Average Propensity to <br> Save (APS) | Marginal Propensity to <br> Save (MPS) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Meaning | It refers to the ratio of saving (S) to the <br> corresponding level of income (Y) at a <br> point of time. | It refers to the ratio of change in saving <br> $(\Delta S)$ to change in total income $(\Delta Y)$ oye <br> a period of time. |
| Value less than zero | APS can be less than zero when there are <br> dissavings, i.e. till consumption is more <br> than national income. | MPS can never be less than zero at <br> change in saving can never be negative <br> i.e. change in consumption can never be <br> more than change in income. |
| Formula | APS $=\frac{S}{Y}$ | MPS $=\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y}$ |

Always Remember: Slope of Saving Curve is indicated by MPS and not by APS.

Relationship between APC and APS 

The sum of APC and APS is equal to one. It can be proved as under:
We know: $\quad Y=C+S$
Dividing both sides by $Y$, we get
$\frac{Y}{Y}=\frac{C}{Y}+\frac{S}{Y}$
$1=\mathrm{APC}+\mathrm{APS}$
$\left[\because \frac{Y}{Y}=1 ; \frac{C}{Y}=\mathrm{APC} ; \frac{S}{Y}=\mathrm{APS}\right.$
$\mathrm{APC}+\mathrm{APS}=1$ because income is either used for consumption or for saving.

Relationship between MPC and MPS

The sum of MPC and MPS is equal to one. It can be proved as under:
We know: $\Delta Y=\Delta C+\Delta S$
Dividing both sides by $\Delta Y$, we get:
$\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta Y}=\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}+\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y}$
$1=\mathrm{MPC}+\mathrm{MPS}$
$\left[\because \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta Y}=1 ; \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}=\mathrm{MPC} ; \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y}=\mathrm{MP}\right.$
$\mathrm{MPC}+\mathrm{MPS}=1$ because total increment in income is either used for consumption or for saving.

Equation of Consumption Function 

The Consumption Function can be put into two parts:
(i) Even when income (Y) is zero, there is some minimum consumption, known as $a u t o n_{0} \mathrm{~s}$ consumption ( $\overline{\mathrm{c}}$ ), which is always positive.
(ii) When income increases, consumption also increases. But, the rate of increasem consumption is less than rate of increase in income. The MPC (or b) shows hown consumption expenditure (C) changes with changes in income. This portion of consumption is termed as Induced Consumption and can be estimated by multiplying MPC by Income, i.e. $b(Y)$.
So, Consumption Function can be represented as: $C=\bar{c}+b(Y)$
(Where: $C=$ Consumption; $\bar{c}=$ Autonomous Consumption; $b=M P C ; Y=$ income
Autonomous consumption expenditure is not influenced by income, whereas, induced consumption is consumption expenditure that changes with change in income.

- The given equation relates to the case of linear consumption function as $C=\bar{c}+b(Y)$ is the equation of a straight line, with ' $\bar{c}$ ' equal to intercept and ' $b$ ' the slope of the consumption function. The higher the value of $b$, the more the slope of the linear consumption function.
- The equation of consumption function can also be used to draw consumption curve. If autonomous consumption ( $\bar{c}$ ) and MPC (b) are given, then consumption expenditure can be calculated for different levels of income. For example, if $\bar{c}=\bar{c} 40$ crores and $b=0.80$, then consumption expenditure (C) at income of $₹ 100$ crores will be: $C=\bar{c}+b(Y)=40+$ $0.80(100)=\varnothing 120$ crores. (Refer Q3. of HOTS for a practical example)


Equation of Saving Function

With the help of the equation of linear consumption function, we can derive the equation of linear saving function:
We know: $\quad S=Y-C$
and

$$
C=\bar{c}+b(Y)
$$

Putting the value of $C$ from (2) in (1), we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S=Y-\{\bar{c}+b(Y)\} \\
& S=-\bar{c}+(1-b) Y
\end{aligned}
$$

(Where: $S=$ Saving; $-\bar{c}=$ Amount of negative saving at zero income level; $1-b=M P S ; Y=$ income)

- The given equation is a case of linear saving function as $S=-\bar{c}+(1-b) Y$ is the equation of a straight line, with ' $-\bar{c}$ ' equal to intercept and ' $(1-b)$ ' the slope of the saving function.
- The equation of saving function can also be used to draw saving curve. If $(-\bar{c})$ and MPS $(1-b)$ are given, then saving expenditure can be calculated for different levels of income. For example, if $-\bar{c}=\bar{c} 40$ crores and $1-b=0.20$, then saving expenditure (S) at income of ₹ 100 crores will be: $S=-\bar{c}+(1-b) Y=-40+0.20(100)=-\varnothing 20$ crores.


Consumption and Saving Curves are Complementary curves

We know: $Y=C+S$. It means, consumption and saving curves are complementary curves as they together make up income. Therefore, if one of the functions is known, then the other can be easily obtained. So we can derive saving curve from the consumption curve and consumption curve from the saving curve.

perivation of Saving Curve from
contsumption Curve
Let us understand derivation of saving curve from onsumption curve through Fig. 7.9.
As seen in the diagram, CC is the consumption curve and $45^{\circ}$ line OY represents the income curve.

- At zero level of income, autonomous consumption (c) is equal to OC. It means, saving at zero level of income will be $\mathrm{OS}(=-\overline{\mathrm{c}})$. As a result, the saving curve will start from point $S$ on the negative $Y$-axis.
- Consumption curve CC intersects income curve OY at point E. This is the break-even point. At point E, Consumption = Income, i.e. APC $=1$ and saving is zero. It means, saving curve will intersect $X$-axis at point $R$. By joining the points $S$ and $R$ and extending it further, we get the saving curve SS.


Derivation of Consumption Curve from Saving Curve: It 

must be noted that consumption curve can also be derived from saving curve in the similar manner. The starting point of consumption curve on the $Y$-axis will be equal to amount of dissaving at zero level of income. The second point of consumption curve will be determined corresponding to point, when saving curve intersects the $X$-axis.

7.7 INVESTMENT FUNCTION

Investment refers to the expenditure incurred on creation of new capital assets. Investment involves addition to the physical capital and changes in the inventory. It includes the expenditure incurred on assets like machinery, building, equipment, raw material, etc. which lead to increase in the productive capacity of an economy. The investment expenditure is classified under two heads:
(i) Induced Investment
(ii) Autonomous investment

Induced Investment

Induced investment refers to the investment which depends on the profit expectations and is directly influenced by income level. It is income elastic, i.e. it increases with increase in income and vice-versa.
As seen in Fig. 7.10, induced investment curve 'II' slopes upwards from left to right indicating that as income increases from OY to $Y_{1}$, investment increases from OM to $\mathrm{OM}_{1}$.

Autonomous Investment

Autonomous investment refers to the investment which is not affected by changes in the leof of income and is not induced solely by profit motive. It is income inelastic, i.e. it is not influenced by change in income.
As seen in Fig. 7.11, the amount of investment remains constant at Ol , irrespective of level of income ( OY or $\mathrm{OY}_{1}$ ) in the economy.

- Autonomous Investments are generally made by Government on infrastructural activities.
- The level of autonomous investment depends on the social, economic and political conditions of the country. So, such investments change when there is change in technology or discovery of new resources or growth of population, etc.

Induced Investment Vs Autonomous Investment

| Basis | Induced Investment | Autonomous Investment |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Motive | It is driven by profit motive, i.e. it depends on profit expectations. | It is done for social welfare and not for profit. |
| Income Elasticity | It is income elastic, i.e. increase in income level raises its level. | It is unaffected by changes in income level. |
| Investment curve | Its curve slopes upwards as it is income elastic (Fig. 7.10). | Its curve is parallel to $X$-axis as it is income inelastic (Fig. 7.11). |
| Sector | It is generally done by the private sector. | It is generally done by the government sector. |

7.8 EX-ANTE AND EX-POST SAVING AND INVESTMENT

'Ex-ante' variable is the planned or expected value of variable, whereas, 'Ex-post' variable is the actual or realised value of the variable. Both these terms are generally used in the context of saving and investment. There are two aspects of saving and investments:
(i) Ex-ante Saving and Ex-ante Investment
(ii) Ex-post Saving and Ex-post Investment

Ex-ante Saving and Ex-ante Investment

Ex-ante saving refers to the amount of saving which households (or savers) plan to save at different levels of income in the economy. In other words, Ex-ante saving refers to the planned savings of an economy at different levels of income. The amount of ex-ante or planned saving is given by the saving function (or propensity to save).
Ex-ante investment refers to the amount of investment which firms plan to invest at different levels of income in the economy. The amount of ex-ante or planned investment is determined by the relation between investment demand and rate of interest, i.e. by investment demand function.

Ex-ante can also be termed as: (i) Intended; (ii) Planned; (iii) Voluntary; (iv) Desired.

In an economy, equilibrium is determined when planned saving is equal to planned investment. However, both these concepts are equal only at equilibrium level of income. It happens because of three reasons:
(i) Generally, saving is done by households and investment is done by firms. So, savers and investors are different people with different priorities.
(ii) Saving is made in small amounts and investment is made in big amounts. is made for profit motive.
As a result, ex-ante saving and ex-ante investment are not always equal to each other. They are equal only at the equilibrium level. Ex-ante variables form the basis of the theory of national income determination.

When ex-ante (planned) saving is not equal to ex-ante (planned) investment, then output will tend to adjust itself till both of them become equal again. It is discussed in detail in the next chapter.

Ex-post Saving and Ex-post Investment 

Ex-post saving refers to the actual or realised saving in an economy during a year. Ex-post or actual saving is the sum total of planned saving and unplanned saving. Ex-post investment refers to the realised or actual investment in an economy during a year. Ex-post or actual investment is the sum total of planned investment and unplanned investment.
It must be noted that ex-post saving and ex-post investment are equal at all levels of income. This equality between the two is brought by fluctuations in income.
Planned value of the variables is their ex-ante measures, whereas, realised value of the variables is their ex-post measures. The significance of distinction between Ex-ante and Ex-post is that all the variables in the Theory of Income Determination are ex-ante variables, i.e. ex-ante variables form the basis of theory of national income determination.

7.9 FULL EMPLOYMENT AND INVOLUNTARY UNEMPLOYMENT

Full Employment

Full employment refers to a situation in which all those people, who are willing and able to work at the existing wage rate, get work without any undue difficulty.
Generally, the term 'full employment' means that there is no unemployment, i.e., everyone gets work. It means, demand for labour is equal to its supply. However, in macroeconomics, there can be some types of unemployment even during full employment. It means, full employment does not stand for zero unemployment or cent per cent employment.
Under full employment, there can be two types of unemployment:
(i) Frictional Unemployment: It refers to temporary unemployment, which exists during the period wherein workers leave one job and join another. It arises due to labour market imperfections such as lack of market information about availability of jobs and a lack of perfect mobility on the part of workers. Introduction of new machines, nationalization in production process or breakdown of plant may also lead to frictional unemployment.

(ii) Structural Unemployment: It refers to the unemployment, in which people remain unemployed due to a mismatch between unemployed persons and the demand for specific types of workers. It is associated with structural changes in the economy. For example, due to computerisation, workers who do not possess enough knowledge of computers will be unemployed until they do some computer course or training.
The presence of these two types of unemployment is referred to as 'Natural rate of Unemployment'.

It must be noted that the concept of Full Employment is explained only in the context of labour force, i.e. working population and not the total population. Labour force refers to that part of the population which is physically and mentally able and at the same time, willing to work. It means, children and old persons will not be considered as they are not supposed to be employed even during full employment.

Involuntary Unemployment 

Involuntary unemployment refers to an unemployment in which all those people, who are willing and able to work at the existing wage rate, do not get work. Under involuntary unemployment, people are rendered unemployed against their wishes or under compulsion. It must be noted that only involuntary unemployment is considered while estimating the total unemployment in an economy. Full employment implies absence of involuntary unemployment.

What is Voluntary Unemployment?

In an economy, it is always possible to find some people who are unwilling to do any productive work, though they may be fit physically and mentally. Voluntary unemployment refers to a situation when a person is unemployed because he is not willing to work at the existing wage rate. Voluntary unemployment is not counted when estimating the size of unemployment.

DETERMINANTS OF INVESTMENT

According to Keynes, the decision to invest in a new project (i.e., private investment) depends upon two factors:

1. Marginal Efficiency of Investment (MEI)
2. Rate of Interest (ROI)

Marginal Efficiency of Investment (MEI)

MEI refers to the expected rate of return from an additional investment. MEI is determined by two factors:
(i) Supply Price: It refers to the cost of producing a new asset of that kind. It is the price at which the new capital asset can be supplied or replaced. For example, if a machine of ₹ 10,000 is replaced in place of an old machine, then ₹ 10,000 is the supply price.
(ii) Prospective Yield: It refers to net return (net of all costs), expected from the capital asset over its lifetime. For example, if the given machine is expected to yield receipts of ₹ 1,200 and running expenses will be ₹ 200, then the prospective yield will be: $1,200-200=\$ 1,000$. In the given example, Marginal Efficiency of Investment will be:

$$
\frac{\text { Prospective Yield }}{\text { Supply Price }} \times 100=\frac{1,000}{10,000} \times 100=10 \%
$$

Rate of Interest (ROI)

It refers to cost of borrowing money for financing the investment. There exists an inverse relationship between ROI and the volume of investment. At a high ROI, the investment spending will be less and vice-versa.

Comparison of MEI with ROI

The profitability of an investment can be worked out by comparing MEI with ROI. If MEI $>$ ROI, then investment is profitable. For instance, if an entrepreneur has to pay $12 \%$ rate of interest on the loan acquired by him and the expected rate of profit, i.e. MEI is $20 \%$, then he will surely go for the investment and will continue making investment till MEI $=$ ROI.
