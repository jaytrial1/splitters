1.1 MEANING OF MACROECONOMICS

The term 'macro' has been derived from the Greek word 'makros' which means 'large'. So, macroeconomics deals with the overall performance of the economy. It is concerned with the study of problems of the economy like inflation, unemployment, poverty, etc. The emergence of Macroeconomics as a separate branch can be traced back to 1936,
when the British Economist Lord J. M. Keynes published his book, 'The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money'. Macroeconomics is that part of economic theory which studies the behaviour of aggregates of the economy as a whole. For example, National income, aggregate output, aggregate consumption, etc. Its main tools are Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply.

Difference between Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

You have already studied Microeconomics in your previous class. Let us now study the various points of difference between Microeconomics and Macroeconomics.

| Basis | Microeconomics | Macroeconomics |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Meaning | Microeconomics is that part of economic theory which studies the behaviour of individual units of an economy. | Macroeconomics is that part of economic theory which studies the behaviour of aggregates of the economy as a whole. |
| Tools | Demand and Supply. | Aggregate Demand \& Aggregate Supply. |
| Basic Objective | It aims to determine the price of a commodity or factors of production. | It aims to determine income and employment level of the economy. |
| Degree of Aggregation | It involves a limited degree of aggregation. For example, market demand is derived by aggregating individual demands of all buyers in the particular market. | It involves the highest degree of aggregation. For example, aggregate demand is derived for the entire economy. |

| Basic Assumptions | It assumes all the macro variables to be constant, i.e., it assumes that national income, consumption, savings, etc. are constant. | It assumes that all the micro variables, like decisions of households and firms, prices of individual products, etc. are constant. |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Other Name | Microeconomics is also known as 'Price Theory' as it is primarily concerned with the determination of prices of commodities and factors of production. | Macroeconomics is also known as 'Income and Employment Theory' as it is primarily concerned with determination of level of income and employment. |
| Examples | Individual income, individual output. | National Income, National output. |

Need for a Separate Theory of Macroeconomics 

Microeconomics failed to study the aggregates of the economy as a whole. As a result, there was a need for a separate theory, which could explain the working of the economy. Macroeconomics helps to understand the working of an economic system as well as to explain the various macroeconomic paradoxes.

1.2 CIRCULAR FLOW OF INCOME

Introduction

The unlimited and recurring wants of human beings have made the production process, a continuous process. In this process, different factors of production: Land, Labour, Capital and Enterprise are combined together for the production of goods and services.

- Firms produce goods and services with collective efforts of factors of production supplied by the household sector.
- Firm makes payment to the factors of production in the form of rent, wages, interest and profit (known as factor incomes).
- The household sector spends this money on the purchase of goods and services produced by the firms.

Thus, income flows first from firms to households in the form of factor payments and then, from households to firms in the form of consumption expenditure. Such a flow of money is known as the circular flow of income.

Meaning of Circular Flow of Income

It refers to the cycle of generation of income in the production process, its distribution among the factors of production and finally, its circulation from households to firms in the form of consumption expenditure on goods and services produced by them.

Phases of Circular Flow of Income

There are 3 different phases (generation, distribution and disposition) in circular flow of income, as shown in the given diagram:

1. Generation Phase: In this phase, firms produce goods and services with the help of factor services.
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Fig. 1.1

2. Distribution Phase: This phase involves the flow of factor income (rent, wages, interest and profit) from firms to the households.
3. Disposition Phase: In this phase, the income received by factors of production, is spent on the goods and services produced by firms.
In this way, income generated in production units returns to production units \& completes the circular flow.

1.3 STOCK AND FLOW 

The concepts of stock and flow are used frequently in macroeconomics. Some of the macro variables relate to stock, while others relate to flow. Therefore, it is important to understand their meaning so that variables can be categorised as stock or flow.

Stock

Stock variable refers to that variable, which is measured at a particular point of time. For example, the stock of goods in the godown as on $31^{\text {st }}$ January, 2025. It means, stock variables are not time dimensional. Some more examples of stock variables are national wealth, national capital, money supply etc.

Flow

Flow variable refers to that variable, which is measured over a period of time. For example, the production of goods during the month of January 2025, the birth rate in the year 2024, National Income in the year 2024 are flow variables. The 'period of time' could be a day, a week, a year, etc. It means, flow variables are time dimensional as they are measured for a period of time.

Examples for Better Clarity

- The amount of water in a tank is the quantity of water in the tank at a given point of time. On the other hand, water flowing from the tank through a tap is a flow of water being added to the tank per unit of time.
- The total number of houses as on $31^{\text {st }}$ December, 2024 is the stock concept, while the number of houses constructed during 2024 is a flow variable.


Mutual Dependence between Stock and Flow

Both stock and flow impact each other. For example, increase in the flow of water into a tank, increase the stock of water in the tank. Similarly, flow of water out of the tank depends on stock of water in the tank. Thus, there is a mutual dependence between stock and flow.

Difference between Stock and Flow

| Basis | Stock | Flow |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Meaning | Stock variable refers to that variable, which is measured at a particular point of time. | Flow variable refers to that variable, which is measured over a period of time. |
| Time <br> Dimension | It does not have a time dimension. | It has a time dimension as its magnitude can be measured over a period of time. |
| Nature of concept | It is a static concept. | It is a dynamic concept. |

Examples

1. Population of India as on 31.03.25.
2. Total number of Maruti cars in Delhi.
3. Money supply (money in circulation).
4. National Wealth.
5. Quantity of wheat stored.

1. Number of births during 2024.
2. Maruti cars manufactured during January, 2025.
3. Expenditure or transactions in money.
4. National Income.
5. Quantity of wheat produced.

1.4 TYPES OF CIRCULAR FLOW 

There are two types of circular flows: (i) Real flow; (ii) Money Flow.

Real Flow

Real flow refers to the flow of factor services from households to firms and the corresponding flow of goods and services from firms to households.
As seen in the diagram, households provide factor services to the firms which, in turn, provide goods and services to them as a reward for their productive services.

- It is also known as 'Physical flow'.
- There is only exchange of goods and services between the two sectors without involvement of any money.
- Real flow determines the magnitude of the growth process in an economy. For example, when more factor services are offered to firms, then volume of production will be more and it speeds up the process of economic growth.

Fig. 1.2
Money Flow
Money Flow refers to flow of factor payments from firms to households for their factor services and corresponding flow of consumption expenditure from households to firms for purchase of goods and services produced by the firms.

As seen in the diagram, firms make factor payments to households for their factor services and households spend this income on the purchase of goods and services produced by the firms.

- It is also known as 'Nominal flow'.
- It involves an exchange of money between the two sectors.

| Meaning | It is the flow of goods and services <br> between firms and households. | It is the flow of money between firms and <br> households. |
| Kind of exchange | It involves exchange of goods and <br> services. | It involves exchange of money. |

| Difficulty in exchange | There may be difficulties of barter system <br> in exchange of goods and factor services. | There is no such difficulty in case of money <br> flow. |

Four Sectors of the Economy 

The four major sectors in an economy according to the macroeconomic point of view are:

1. Household Sector: It includes consumers of goods and services and the owners of factors of production. They supply factors like land, labour, capital and entrepreneur and receive income in return in the form of rent, wages, interest and profit respectively.
2. Producing Sector (Firms): It includes all producing firms in the economy. To produce goods and services, the firm hires factors of production from the households.
Households consume goods and services to satisfy their wants and firms produce goods and services to make a profit.
3. Government Sector: It acts in two capacities:

As a welfare agency, it is involved in maintaining law and order, defence and other services of public welfare.

- As a producer, it produces goods and services in public sector enterprises.

4. Foreign Sector (or External Sector or Rest of the World Sector): This sector includes transactions with the rest of the world. It is involved in the export and import of goods and the flow of capital between the domestic economy and other countries of the world.

1.5 CIRCULAR FLOW IN A SIMPLE ECONOMY (TWO-SECTOR ECONOMY)

A simple economy assumes the existence of only two sectors, i.e. household sector \& firm sector.

- Households are the owners of factors of production and consumers of goods and services.
- Firms produce goods and services and sell them to the households.

It is the simplest form of closed economy**, in which there is no government sector and foreign sector.

Closed Economy and Open Economy

Closed Economy is an economy which has no economic relations with the rest of the world. However, in the current scenario, there is hardly any country which does not have any economic relations with other nations. A closed economy has 3 sectors: Household Sector, Producing Sector and Government Sector, i.e. it does not have any Foreign Sector.
Open Economy is an economy which has economic relations with the rest of the world. In the current scenario, all the nations have economic relations with other nations. An open economy has 4 sectors: Household Sector, Producing Sector, Government Sector and Foreign Sector.

In order to make our analysis simple, we take some assumptions:

1. There are only 2 sectors in the economy: Households and Firms. It means, there is no government and foreign sector.
![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

2. Household sector supplies factor services only to firms and the firms hire factor services only from households.
3. Firms produce goods and services and sell their entire output to the households.
4. Households receive factor income for their services and spend the entire amount on consumption of goods and services.
5. There are no savings in the economy, i.e. neither the households save from their incomes, nor the firms save from their profits.
The Circular flow in Two-Sector economy can be better understood with the help of Fig. 1.4.

- The outer loop of the diagram shows the real flow, i.e. the flow of factor services from households to firms and the corresponding flow of goods and services from firms to households.
- The inner loop shows the money flow, i.e. flow of factor payments from firms to households and the corresponding flow of consumption expenditure from households to firms.
![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

Fig. 1.4

It must be noted that the entire amount of money, which is paid by firms as factor payments is paid back by the factor owners to the firms. So, there is a circular and continuous flow of money income.

In the circular flow of income, production generates factor income, which is converted into expenditure. This flow of income continues as production is a continuous activity due to neverending human wants. It makes the flow of income circular.

Conclusions of Circular Flow in a Simple Economy 

In a Two-Sector Economy, the following Conclusions can be drawn:
(i) Total Production of goods and services by Firms = Total Consumption of goods and services by Households.
(ii) Factor Payments by firms = Factor Incomes of households.
(iii) Consumption Expenditure by households = Factor Income of households.
(iv) Real Flow in the form of factor services and final goods and services = Money Flow between firms and households.

PIOIRIER:BIOISETIEIR 

1. CIRCULAR FLOW IN A TWO-SECTOR ECONOMY (WITH FINANCIAL MARKET)

Circular Flow in a two-sector economy without the financial market assumed that there are no savings, i.e., households spend their entire income on purchase of goods and services and firms spend all the receipts from sale of goods and services in making factor payments.
But, in actual practice, households do not spend their entire income on consumption, i.e., a part of their income is saved. Similarly, firms also save some part of their receipts for expansion or other reasons. Firms also borrow money to finance their expansion programmes. All savings and borrowings are channelised through a financial market. Financial market refers to institutions such as banks, insurance companies etc., which transact in loanable funds. Savings of households accumulated in the financial market are utilised by firms for investment purposes. So, the circular flow of income continues as shown in the following diagram:
![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)

Fig. 1.5

2. CIRCULAR FLOW IN A THREE-SECTOR ECONOMY

Circular flow of income in a three-sector economy consists of households, firms and the government sector. Government plays a very important role in the economic development of a country. It acts as both consumer and a firm. As a consumer, it spends on consumption of goods and services produced by firms. As a producer, it produces goods and services for the economy. In addition to flows of circular flow in two-sector economy with financial market, the introduction of Government leads to following flows:

- Between Households and Government: Money flows from government to households in the form of: (i) Transfer payments like scholarships, old age pension, etc.; and (ii) Factor payments for hiring factor services of households.

Money flows back to the government from households in the form of direct taxes like income tax, interest tax, etc.

- Between Firms and Government: Money flows from firms in the form of direct taxes and indirect taxes.
Money flows to the firms from government, when the latter grants subsidies and makes payment to the former for purchase of goods and services produced by the firms.

A part of the income earned by government is also saved and deposited in the financial market. Government also borrows money from the financial market to meet its expenditure. A brief summary of this circular flow is given in the following diagram:
![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

Fig. 1.6

3. ROLE OF GOVERNMENT SECTOR IN AN ECONOMY 

Government Sector performs the following activities in the economy:
(a) Government collects taxes from households and firms.
(b) Government makes transfer payments to the households and provides subsidies to the firms.
(c) Government makes the payment for purchase of goods and services from the firms.
(d) Government saves and borrows money with the help of financial market.

4. CIRCULAR FLOW IN A FOUR-SECTOR ECONOMY

Circular flow of income in a four-sector economy consists of households, firms, government and foreign sector. The various money flows in each sector are:

- Household Sector: Households provide factor services to firms, government and foreign sector. In return, it receives factor payments. Households also receive transfer payments from the government and the foreign sector. Households spend their income on: (i) Payment for goods and services purchased from firms; (ii) Tax payments to government; (iii) Payments for imports.

- Firms: Firms receive revenue from households, government and the foreign sector for sale of their goods and services. Firms also receive subsidies from the government. Firm makes payments for: (i) Factor services to households; (ii) Taxes to the government; (iii) Imports to the foreign sector.
- Government: Government receives revenue from firms, households and the foreign sector for sale of goods and services, taxes, fees, etc. Government makes factor payments to households and also spends money on transfer payments and subsidies.
- Foreign Sector: Foreign sector receives revenue from firms, households and government for export of goods and services. It makes payments for import of goods and services from firms and the government. It also makes payment for the factor services to the households. The savings of households, firms and the government sector get accumulated in the financial market. Financial market invests money by lending out money to households, firms and the government. The inflows of money in the financial market are equal to outflows of money. It makes the circular flow of income complete and continuous. The circular flow of income in a four-sector economy is shown in Fig. 1.7.

5. SIGNIFICANCE OF CIRCULAR FLOW OF INCOME 

Study of circular flow of income is important due to the following reasons:

1. It helps us to understand the mutual interdependence among different sectors of the economy namely household sector, producer sector, government sector and foreign sector. It shows that all the sectors are complementary to one another in such a way that the economic activity remains intact.

2. It shows the equilibrium position of the economy. If there is any distortion in the circular flow, the economy will be in disequilibrium and the smooth functioning of the economy will be disturbed.
3. It helps in identifying various types of leakages and injections in the economy.
4. It helps in estimation of national income. Circular flow shows the three phases of flow of income (generation, distribution and disposition). It facilitates determination of three different ways (production, income and expenditure methods) in which the flow of income can be measured.

6. LEAKAGES AND INJECTIONS 

Leakages

Leakages refer to withdrawal of money from the circular flow. When households and firms save a part of their incomes, it leads to a leakage from the circular flow of income. Leakage or withdrawal refers to that part of income, which does not pass through the circular flow of income. As a result, it is not available for spending on currently produced goods and services. It means, leakages reduce the flow of Income.

Examples of Leakages in different types of Economies

1. Two-sector economy (without Financial Market) »» No Leakage
2. Two-sector economy (with Financial Market) »» Savings
3. Three-sector economy »» Savings + Taxes
4. Four-sector economy »» Savings + Taxes + Imports

Injections

Injection refers to the introduction of income into the circular flow. When households and firms borrow money from external sources like financial institutions, it adds to their income. Such additional income does not result in immediate expenditure. So, injections increase the flow of income.

Examples of Injections in different types of Economies

1. Two-sector economy (without Financial Market)
2. Two-sector economy (with Financial Market)
3. Three-sector economy
4. Four-sector economy

»» No Injection

" Investment
" Investment + Govt. Exp.
" Investment + Govt. Exp. + Exports

It must be noted that Equilibrium is achieved when injections are equal to Leakages.
