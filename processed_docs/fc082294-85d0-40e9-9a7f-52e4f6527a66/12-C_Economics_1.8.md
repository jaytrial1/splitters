Determination and Multiplier

8.1 DETERMINATION OF EQUILIBRIUM LEVEL

According to the Keynesian Theory, equilibrium condition is generally stated in terms of aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS). An economy is in equilibrium when aggregate demand for goods and services is equal to aggregate supply during a period of time.

So, equilibrium is achieved when:

$$
A D=A S
$$

We know, AD is the sum total of Consumption (C) and Investment (I):

$$
A D=C+I
$$

Also, AS is the sum total of consumption (C) and saving (S):

$$
A S=C+S
$$

Substituting (2) and (3) in (1), we get:

$$
C+S=C+I
$$

Or, $\quad S=1$
It means, according to Keynes, there are Two Approaches for determining the equilibrium level of income and employment in the economy.
It must be noted that Equilibrium level of income and employment can also be determined according to 'Classical Theory'. However, the scope of syllabus is limited to the Keynesian theory.
Two Approaches for Determination of Equilibrium Level
The two approaches to determine equilibrium level of income, output and employment in the economy are:

1. Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply Approach (AD-AS Approach)
2. Saving-Investment Approach (S-I Approach)
It must be kept in mind that AD, AS, Saving and Investment are all planned or ex-ante variables.

Assumptions 

Before we proceed further, let us first state the various assumptions made in determination of equilibrium output:
(i) The determination of equilibrium output is to be studied in the context of two-sector mode (households \& firms). It means, it is assumed that there is no government \& foreign sector.
(ii) It is assumed that investment expenditure is autonomous, i.e. investments are not influenced by level of income.
(iii) Price level is assumed to remain constant.
(iv) Equilibrium output is to be determined in the context of the short-run.

Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply Approach (AD-AS Approach)

According to the Keynesian theory, the equilibrium level of income in an economy is determined when aggregate demand, represented by $C+I$ curve is equal to the total output (Aggregate Supply or AS). Aggregate demand comprises of two components:

- Consumption expenditure (C): It varies directly with the level of income, i.e. consumption rises with increase in income.
- Investment expenditure (I): It is assumed to be independent of the level of income, i.e. investment expenditure is autonomous.
So, AD curve is represented by $(\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{I})$ curve in the income determination analysis.
Aggregate supply is the total output of goods and services of the national income. It is depicted by a $45^{\circ}$ line. Since the income received is either consumed or saved, the AS curve is represented by the $(C+S)$ curve. The determination of equilibrium level of income can be better understood with the help of the following schedule and diagram:

Table 8.1: Equilibrium by AD and AS Approach

| Employment <br> (Lakhs) | Income <br> (Y) | Consumption <br> (C) | Saving <br> (S) | Investment <br> (I) | AD <br> $\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{I}$ | AS <br> $\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{S}$ | Remarks |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 0 | 0 | 40 | $-40$ | 40 | 80 | 0 | $A D>A S$ |
| 10 | 100 | 120 | $-20$ | 40 | 160 | 100 | $A D>A S$ |
| 20 | 200 | 200 | 0 | 40 | 240 | 200 | $A D>A S$ |
| 30 | 300 | 280 | 20 | 40 | 320 | 300 | $A D>A S$ |
| 40 | 400 | 360 | 40 | 40 | 400 | 400 | Equilibrium <br> (AD = AS) |
| 50 | 500 | 440 | 60 | 40 | 480 | 500 | $A D<A S$ |
| 60 | 600 | 520 | 80 | 40 | 560 | 600 | $A D<A S$ |

In Fig. 8.1, the AD or $(\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{I})$ curve shows the desired level of expenditure by consumers and firms corresponding to each level of income. The economy is in equilibrium at point ' $E$ ' where $(\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{I})$ curve intersects the $45^{\circ}$ line.

- ' $E$ ' is the equilibrium point because at this point, the level of desired spending on consumption and investment exactly equals the level of total output.
- OY is the equilibrium level of output corresponding to point E.

- In Table 8.1, the equilibrium level of income is ₹ 400 crores, when $A D($ or $C+I)=A S=\mathbb{4} 400$ crores.
- It is a situation of 'Effective Demand'. Effective demand refers to that level of AD which becomes 'effective' because it is equal to AS.
if there is any deviation from the equilibrium level of output, i.e. when planned spending ( $A D$ ) is not equal to planned output (AS), then a process of readjustment will start in the economy and the output will tend to adjust up or down until $A D$ and $A S$ are equal again.
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Fig. 8.1

When AD is more than AS 

When planned spending (AD) is more than planned output (AS), then ( $\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{I}$ ) curve lies above the $45^{\circ}$ line. It means that consumers and firms together would be buying more goods than firms are willing to produce. As a result, the *planned inventory would fall below the desired level.
To bring the inventory back to the desired level, firms would resort to increase in production. It will increase the employment and output level, which in turn will raise the income level. This process will continue until the economy is back at output level OY, where AD becomes equal to $A S$ and there is no further tendency to change.
*Planned Inventory is the unsold stock of goods which has been anticipated in case of an expected fall in sales, while Unplanned Inventory refers to the unanticipated change in stock due to unexpected fall in sales.

When AD is less than AS

When $A D<A S$, then $(C+I)$ curve lies below the $45^{\circ}$ line. It means that consumers and firms together would be buying lesser goods than firms are willing to produce. As a result, the planned inventory would rise.
To clear the unwanted increase in inventory, firms plan to decrease the production. It will decrease the employment and output level, which in turn will reduce the income level. This process will continue until the economy is back at output level OY, where AD becomes equal to AS and there is no further tendency to change.

It must be noted that equilibrium level may or may not be at the level of full employment, i.e. equilibrium is possible even at a level lower than the full employment level. For instance, in Table 8.1, employment level is 40 lakhs corresponding to equilibrium income of ₹ 400 crores. It is not the full employment level since employment increases even after the equilibrium level.

Saving-Investment Approach (S-I Approach)

According to this approach, the equilibrium level of income is determined at a level, when planned saving (S) is equal to planned investment (I).

Let us understand this with the help of following schedule and diagram:

Table 8.2: Equilibrium by Saving and Investment Approach

| Income <br> (Y) | Consumption <br> (C) | Saving <br> (S) | Investment <br> (I) | Amount in 700 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 0 | 40 | -40 | 40 | $S<1$ |
| 100 | 120 | -20 | 40 | $S<1$ |
| 200 | 200 | 0 | 40 | $S<i$ |
| 300 | 280 | 20 | 40 | $S<1$ |
| 400 | 360 | 40 | 40 | Equilibrium <br> (S = I) |
| 500 | 440 | 60 | 40 | $S>1$ |
| 600 | 520 | 80 | 40 | $S>1$ |

In Fig 8.2, Investment curve (I) is parallel to the X-axis because of the autonomous character of investments. The Saving curve (S) slopes upwards showing that as income rises, saving also rises.

- The economy is in equilibrium at point ' $E$ ' where saving and investment curves intersect each other.
- At point ' $E$ ', ex-ante saving is equal to ex-ante investment.
- OY is the equilibrium level of output corresponding to point $E$.
- In Table 8.2, the equilibrium level of income is ₹ 400 crores, when planned saving = planned investment $=\mathbb{\pi} 40$ crores.
If there is any deviation from the equilibrium level of income, i.e., if planned saving is not equal to the planned investment, then a process of readjustment will start which will bring the economy back to the equilibrium level.
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Fig. 8.2

When Saving is more than Investment 

If planned saving is more than planned investment, i.e. after point ' $E$ ' in Fig. 8.2, it means that households are not consuming as much as the firms expected them to. As a result, the inventory rises above the desired level.
To clear the unwanted increase in inventory, firms would plan to reduce production. It will decrease the employment and output level, which in turn will reduce the income level. This process will continue till saving and investment become equal to each other.

When Saving is less than Investment 

If planned saving is less than planned investment, i.e. before point ' $E$ ' in Fig. 8.2, it means that households are consuming more and saving less than what the firms expected them to. As a result, planned inventory would fall below the desired level.
To bring the inventory back to the desired level, firms would plan to increase the production. It will increase the employment and output level, which in turn will raise the income level. This process will continue till saving and investment become equal to each other.

8.2 EQUILIBRIUM LEVEL

According to the classical economists, equilibrium level of income is attained always at full employment level, i.e. there is absence of involuntary unemployment. However, as per the Keynesian theory, equilibrium level can be achieved at:
(i) Full employment level; or
(ii) Underemployment level, i.e. less than full employment level; or
(iii) Over full employment level, i.e. more than full employment level.

Let us discuss the three possibilities of equilibrium level.

Full Employment Equilibrium

It refers to a situation when the aggregate demand is equal to the aggregate supply at full employment level.

- In Fig. 8.3, E is the full employment equilibrium because aggregate demand 'EQ' is equal to full employment level of output 'OQ'.
- At OQ level of output, all those who are willing to work at the prevailing wage rate, are able to find employment, i.e. there is no involuntary unemployment.


Underemployment Equilibrium

It refers to a situation when the aggregate demand is equal to the aggregate supply when the resources are not fully employed. It occurs prior to the full employment level.

- In Fig. 8.4, $\mathrm{AD}_{1}=\mathrm{AS}$ at point ' F ' which is lower than full employment level.
- As $\mathrm{OQ}_{1}$ is less than OQ, point ' F ' signifies the underemployment equilibrium.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

Fig. 8.3
![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

Fig. 8.4

Over Full Employment Equilibrium 

It refers to a situation when $A D$ is equal to AS beyond the full employment level. It occurs after the full employment level.

- In Fig. 8.5, $\mathrm{AD}_{1}=$ AS at point ' G ' which is higher than the full employment level.
- Point ' G ' signifies the over full employment equilibrium.
![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

Fig. 8.5

Over Full Employment Equilibrium creates Inflationary Pressure

- Over Full Employment Equilibrium signifies that planned expenditure (AD) is equal to planned output (AS) at a level higher than full employment level.
- However, in reality, actual output cannot increase beyond this level as economy is already at full employment and there is no idle capacity.
- So, any increase in AD beyond the full employment output, will lead to increase in general price level (i.e. inflation) and there will be no real increase in output.


Short-run Fixed Price Analysis of Product Market

In the short-run, prices take some time to respond to the forces of excess supply or demand as producers try to update their production plans in the mean time. For instance, in case of excess supply, firms plan to produce less in the next cycle in order to avoid accumulation of inventory. Also, an individual firm is very small in relation to entire market and is not in a position to influence the market price.
As a result, an individual firm has to accept the price that prevails in the market. Price levet remains constant and it changes only when the economy is unable to eliminate the effect of excess demand or supply. So, it is assumed that prices remain constant in short-run and var in the long-run.
In order to derive aggregate demand under fixed price of final goods (i.e. in the short-run), it has to be assumed that elasticity of supply is infinite, i.e. suppliers are willing to supply whatet amount consumers will demand at the given constant price. It is a necessary assumption becalue if quantity supplied exceeds or falls short of quantity demanded at this price, then price will change because of excess supply or demand. So, when aggregate supply (AS) is assumed to be comtunt, equilibrium is solely determined by aggregate demand (AD). We call it 'Effective Demand Princtly Effective Demand refers to the total demand of the community which is met by corresponding supy

Determination of Equilibrium Output under Fixed Price Model

Under 'Fixed Price Model', the equilibrium output of final goods is determined solely by aggrtent demand (AD).
In a two-sector model, AD is a function of Consumption (C) and Investment (I).

It means, $\mathrm{AD}=\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{I}$
We also know, consumption function is given by:

$$
C=\bar{c}+b(Y)
$$

Where, $\bar{c}=$ Autonomous Consumption; $b=$ MPC; and $Y=$ Income.
We also know, that ' $b$ ' or MPC shows the rate at which consumption increases with increase in income, i.e. ' $b$ ' shows the slope of consumption function.
The investments are assumed to be autonomous investments, i.e. they are not influenced by the level of income.
It means, $I=\bar{I}=$ Autonomous Investment
Putting value of $C$ from (ii) and I from (iii) in (i), we get:

$$
\mathrm{AD}=\overline{\mathrm{c}}+\mathrm{b}(\mathrm{Y})+\overline{\mathrm{I}}
$$

Or, $\quad A D=\bar{c}+\bar{I}+b(Y)$
Or, $\quad A D=\bar{A}+b(Y)$
[Total Autonomous Expenditure $(\bar{A})=\bar{c}+\bar{I}]$
Now, equilibrium level of aggregate demand (AD) or national income ( Y ) depends on the values of autonomous expenditure ( $\bar{A}$ ) and MPC (or b). Let us determine the equilibrium with the help of Fig. 8.6:
As seen in the diagram, when autonomous expenditure in the economy is $\bar{A}_{1}$, the AD line intersects the $45^{\circ}$ line at point ' $E$ '. So, point ' $E$ ' is determined as the equilibrium point, at which equilibrium output is $O Y$.
However, if autonomous expenditure increases from $\bar{A}_{1}$ to $\bar{A}_{2}$, the AD line will shift to $\mathrm{AD}_{1}$. Due to increase in autonomous expenditure, EG is the amount of excess

Fig. 8.6
demand. Now, point $E$ will no longer represent the equilibrium point. The new equilibrium will be determined when new aggregate demand line, i.e. $\mathrm{AD}_{1}$ intersects the $45^{\circ}$ line. That occurs at point $\mathrm{E}_{1}$. It is the new equilibrium point. The new equilibrium output and aggregate demand will be determined at $\mathrm{OY}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{AD}_{1}$ respectively.

Example for Better Understanding 

Q. 1. Estimate the value of ex-ante AD, when autonomous investment and consumption expenditure (A) is $\bar{c} 50$ crores and MPS is 0.2 and level of income is $₹ 300$ crores.
(CBSE, Sample Paper 2018, Delhi \& Al Comptt. 2022 (II))
Ans. MPC $=1-$ MPS $=1-0.2=0.8$
In a two-sector model, $A D$ is a function of Consumption (C) and Investment (I).
It means, $A D=C+I$
Also, Consumption Function is given by: $C=\bar{c}+b(Y)$
Where, $\bar{c}=$ Autonomous Consumption; $b=$ MPC; and $Y=$ Income.
Investments are assumed to be autonomous investments, i.e. $I=\bar{I}$

(Cont...)

It means, $A D=\bar{c}+b(Y)+\bar{i}$ or $A D=\bar{c}+\bar{i}+b(Y)$
$A D=\bar{A}+b Y$
$[:$ Total Autonomous Expenditure $(\bar{A})=\bar{c}+\bar{i}]$
$A D=50+0.8(300)$
$A D=\mathbb{7} 290$ Crores
Q. 2. On the basis of following information, identify whether the economy is in equilibrium or not:
(CBSE, 2020 (58:4/1))
![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)

Ans. The economy is in equilibrium when $A D=A S(Y)$
$A D=\bar{A}+b Y$
$A D=500+0.8(4,000)$
(Given $Y=\mathbb{7} 4,000$ crores)
$A D=500+3,200$
$A D=\mathbb{7} 3,700$ crores
Since, $A D(\mathbb{7} 3,700$ crores) < AS ( $\mathbf{7} 4,000$ crores), the economy is not in equilibrium.

8.3 CONCEPT OF INVESTMENT MULTIPLIER 

The concept of 'Investment Multiplier' is an important contribution of Prof. J. M. Keynes. Keynes believed that an initial increment in investment increases the final income by many times. Multiplier expresses the relationship between an initial increment in investment and the resulting increase in aggregate income.
In practice, it is observed that when investment is increased by a certain amount, then the change in income is not restricted to the extent of the initial investment, but it changes several times the change in investment. In other words, change in income is a multiple of the change in investment. Multiplier explains how many times the income increases as a result of an increase in the investment.
Multiplier ( $k$ ) is the ratio of increase in national income ( $\Delta \mathrm{Y}$ ) due to an increase in investment ( $\Delta$ ).
$\mathbf{k}=\frac{\Delta \mathrm{Y}}{\Delta \mathrm{I}}$
Suppose an additional investment ( $\Delta \mathrm{I}$ ) of $\mathbf{7} 4,000$ crores in an economy generates an additional income ( $\Delta \mathrm{Y}$ ) of $\mathbf{7} 16,000$ crores. The value of multiplier ( k ), in this case will be:

$$
k=\frac{16,000}{4,000}=4
$$

It means, income increased 4 times with a single increase in investment.

Multiplier and MPC

There exists a direct relationship between MPC and the value of multiplier. Higher the MPC. more will be the value of multiplier, and vice-versa.
The concept of multiplier is based on the fact that one person's expenditure is another person ${ }^{x}$ income. When investment is increased, it also increases the income of the people. People ${ }^{\text {spend }}$

part of this increased income on consumption. However, the amount of increased income spent on consumption depends on the value of MPC.

- In case of higher MPC, people will spend a large proportion of their increased income on consumption. In such case, value of multiplier will be more.
- In case of low MPC, people will spend lesser proportion of their increased income on consumption. In such case, value of multiplier will be comparatively less.
Thus, the value of multiplier depends upon the MPC (refer Table 8.3).


Algebraic Relationship between Multiplier and MPC 

The algebraic relation between Multiplier and MPC can be derived in the following manner: We know, at equilibrium, income (Y) is the sum total of consumption (C) and investment (I).

$$
Y=C+I
$$

Similarly, any change in income ( $\Delta \mathrm{Y}$ ) will also be equal to $(\Delta \mathrm{C}+\Delta \mathrm{I})$.

$$
\Delta Y=\Delta C+\Delta I
$$

Dividing both sides by $\Delta \mathrm{Y}$, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta Y}=\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}+\frac{\Delta I}{\Delta Y} \\
& 1=\mathrm{MPC}+\frac{1}{\mathrm{k}} \\
& \text { or } \quad k=\frac{1}{1-\mathrm{MPC}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Multiplier (k) in terms of MPS

We know,

$$
\mathrm{k}=\frac{1}{(1-\mathrm{MPC})}
$$

We also know, $1-\mathrm{MPC}=\mathrm{MPS}$
So,

$$
k=\frac{1}{\mathrm{MPS}}
$$

It means, the value of multiplier can be known if the MPC or the MPS is known.
![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

Multiplier is directly related to MPC and inversely related to MPS
The value of multiplier depends upon the value of marginal propensity to consume. Multiplier (k) and MPC are directly related, i.e., when MPC is more, k is more and vice-versa. On the contrary, higher the MPS, lower will be the value of multiplier and vice-versa. This can be made clear with the help of the following table:

Table 8.3: Multiplier, MPC and MPS

| MPC | MPS <br> (1 - MPC) | Multiplier (k) <br> $\mathbf{k}=\frac{1}{1-\text { MPC }}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 0 | 1 | $1\left(=\frac{1}{1-0}\right)$ |
| 0.50 | 0.50 | $2\left(=\frac{1}{1-0.50}\right)$ |
| 0.67 | 0.33 | $3\left(=\frac{1}{1-0.67}\right)$ |
| 0.75 | 0.25 | $4\left(=\frac{1}{1-0.75}\right)$ |
| 0.80 | 0.20 | $5\left(=\frac{1}{1-0.80}\right)$ |
| 0.90 | 0.10 | $10\left(=\frac{1}{1-0.90}\right)$ |
| 1 | 0 | $\infty\left(=\frac{1}{1-1}\right)$ |

It is clear from Table 8.3, that multiplier is directly related to MPC and inversely related to MPS.

Maximum Value of Multiplier 

The maximum value of multiplier is infinity when the value of MPC is 1 . MPC $=1$ indicates that the economy decides to consume the whole of its additional income. Here, not even a bit of the additional income is saved. It will lead to a continuous increase in the consumption expenditure and value of multiplier will be infinity.
Proof:
We know; $\quad \mathrm{k}=\frac{1}{1-\mathrm{MPC}}$
When MPC $=1$, then:

$$
\mathrm{k}=\frac{1}{1-1}=\frac{1}{0}=\infty
$$

(as any number, when divided by 0 , gives infinity)

Minimum Value of Multiplier

The minimum value of multiplier is one when the value of MPC is zero. MPC $=0$ indicates that the economy decides to save the whole of its additional income and nothing is spent as consumption expenditure. So, there will be no further increase in income. As a result, the total increase in income $(\Delta \mathrm{Y})$ will be equal to the increase in investment $(\Delta \mathrm{I})$, i.e., $\Delta \mathrm{Y}=\Delta \mathrm{I}$. Here, the value of multiplier is equal to 1 .
Proof: We know; $\mathbf{k}=\frac{1}{1-\mathrm{MPC}}$
When MPC $=0$, then:

$$
\mathrm{k}=\frac{1}{1-0}=\frac{1}{1}=1
$$

working of Multiplier

The working of multiplier is based on the fact that One person's expenditure is another person's income'. When an additional investment is made, then income increases many times more than the increase in investment. Let us understand this with the help of an example.

- Suppose, an additional investment of ₹ 100 crores ( $\Delta \mathrm{I}$ ) is made to construct a flyover. This extra investment will generate an extra income of $\$ 100$ crores in the first round. But this is not the end of the story.
- If MPC is assumed to be 0.90 , then recipients of this additional income will spend $90 \%$ of ₹ 100 crores, i.e. ₹ 90 crores as consumption expenditure and the remaining amount will be saved. It will increase the income by ₹ 90 crores in the second round.
- In the next round, $90 \%$ of the additional income of ₹ 90 crores, i.e. ₹ 81 crores will be spent on consumption \& the remaining amount will be saved.
![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)
- This multiplier process will go on and the consumption expenditure in every round will be 0.90 times of the additional income received from the previous round. The multiplier process is shown in Table 8.4.

Table 8.4: Working of Multiplier (MPC $=0.90$ )

| Round | Increase in investment ( $\Delta \mathrm{I}$ ) ( $\uparrow$ Crores) | Increase in Income ( $\Delta \mathrm{Y}$ ) ( $\uparrow$ Crores) | Increase in Consumption ( $\Delta \mathrm{C}$ ) ( $\uparrow$ Crores) $(\Delta Y \times M P C)$ | Increase In <br> Saving <br> ( $\uparrow$ Crores) <br> $(\Delta S=\Delta Y-\Delta C)$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $1^{\text {st }}$ | 100 | 100 | $90(100 \times 0.9)$ | 10 |
| $2^{\text {nd }}$ |  | 90 | $81(90 \times 0.9)$ | 9 |
| $3^{\text {rd }}$ |  | 81 | $72.90(81 \times 0.9)$ | 8.10 |
| $4^{\text {th }}$ |  | 72.90 | $65.61(72.90 \times 0.9)$ | 7.29 |
| $5^{\text {th }}$ |  | 65.61 | - | - |
| - |  | - | - | - |
| - |  | - | - | - |
| - |  | - | - | - |
| - |  | - | - | - |
| - |  | - | - | - |
| - |  | - | - | - |
| - |  |  |  |  |

Thus, an initial investment of ₹ 100 crores leads to a total increase of ₹ 1,000 crores in the income. As a result, Multiplier $(\mathrm{k})=\frac{\Delta \mathrm{Y}}{\Delta \mathrm{I}}=\frac{1,000}{100}=10$

One more way to Calculate Total Increase in Income 

The total increase in income can also be calculated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { ₹ } 100 \text { crores }=\quad 1 \times \text { ₹ } 100 \text { crores } \\
& +\quad+\quad \\
& \text { ₹ } 90 \text { crores } \quad 0.9 \times \text { ₹ } 100 \text { crores } \\
& +\quad+\quad \\
& \text { ₹ } 81 \text { crores } \quad(0.9)^{2} \times \text { ₹ } 100 \text { crores } \\
& +\quad+\quad \\
& \text { ₹ } 72.90 \text { crores } \quad\left(0.9)^{3} \times \text { ₹ } 100 \text { crores } \\
& +\quad+\quad \\
& \text { ₹ } 65.61 \text { crores } \quad\left(0.9)^{4} \times \text { ₹ } 100 \text { crores } \\
& +\quad+\quad \\
& \text { ₹ } 1,000 \text { crores }=\quad\left[\frac{1}{1-.9}\right] \times \text { ₹ } 100 \text { crores }
\end{aligned}
$$

Diagrammatic Presentation of Multiplier

The multiplier can also be shown graphically using the AD and AS approach. In Fig. 8.7, income is taken on the X -axis and aggregate demand on the Y-axis. Suppose, the initial equilibrium is determined at point E where AD curve intersects the AS curve. The equilibrium level of income is OY. Now, suppose that the investment increases by $\Delta \mathrm{I}$, so that the new aggregate demand curve $\left(\mathrm{AD}_{1}\right)$ intersects the aggregate supply curve (AS) at point ' $F$ '. Thus, the new equilibrium level of income is $\mathrm{OY}_{1}$. The income rises from OY to $\mathrm{OY}_{1^{\prime}}$ in response to an initial
![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)

Fig. 8.7
increase in investment ( $\Delta \mathrm{I}$ ). It is clear from the figure that the increase in income ( $\mathrm{YY}_{1}$ or $\Delta \mathrm{Y}$ ) is greater than increase in investment ( $\Delta \mathrm{I}$ ). The value of multiplier is given by $\mathrm{k}=\frac{\Delta \mathrm{Y}}{\Delta \mathrm{I}}$.

Reverse Operation of the Multiplier

Multiplier works in the forward direction as well as in the backward direction. If the investment decreases, the multiplier operates in the backward direction. A reduction in investment leads to contraction in the income and consumption. It will lead to a cumulative decline in the income and consumption levels; till the total contraction in income is the product of the value of multiplier and the initial decrease in investment. Let us understand this with the help of an example:

(Cont...)
Suppose, investment decreases by ₹ 20 crores. With MPC $=0.5$ and $k=1 /(1-M P C)=2$, there will be net reduction in income to the extent of ₹ 40 crores. Higher the MPC, greater the value of multiplier and greater the cumulative decline in income. The multiplier is, thus, symmetric and works in both directions (forward and backward), i.e., it is a double-edged weapon.
