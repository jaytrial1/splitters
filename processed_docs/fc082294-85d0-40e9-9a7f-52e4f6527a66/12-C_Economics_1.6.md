Banking: 

Commercial Banks and the Central Bank

6.1 COMMERCIAL BANK

Commercial bank is primary unit of the Indian Banking System. Like other businesses, commercial banks also aim to earn profits and for this, they offer a variety of services to their customers.
Commercial bank is an institution which performs the functions of accepting deposits, granting loans and making investments, with the aim of earning profits. State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB), Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank are some examples of Commercial Banks in India.

Commercial Banks - Backbone of an Economy

- It can be very well assumed that the household sector saves a part of its income which is made available to the productive sector for further investment.
- Commercial banks act as financial intermediaries whose main function is to collect savings from the household sector and lend it to the productive sector.
- The rate of interest at which commercial banks accept deposits is known as 'borrowing rate' and the rate at which banks lend out their reserves to investors is called the 'lending rate'.
- The difference between the two rates, known as 'spread', is the profit earned by the banks.


6.2 FUNCTIONS OF A COMMERCIAL BANK

The functions performed by commercial banks can be broadly categorised under two heads:
(1) Primary Functions; (2) Secondary Functions.

Primary Functions

Commercial banks perform two primary functions:

1. Accepting Deposits
2. Advancing of Loans

1. Accepting Deposits 

It is the most important function of commercial banks. They accept deposits in several forno according to requirements of different sections of the society. The main kinds of deposits are
(i) Current Account Deposits: These deposits refer to those deposits which are repayable by the banks on demand.

- Such deposits are generally maintained by businessmen with the intention of making transactions with such deposits.
- They can be drawn upon by a cheque without any restriction.
- Banks do not pay any interest on these accounts. Rather, banks impose service charges for running these accounts.
(ii) Fixed Deposits or Time Deposits or Term Deposits: Fixed deposits refer to those deposits, in which the amount is deposited with the bank for a fixed period of time.
- Such deposits do not enjoy chequable facility.
- These deposits carry a high rate of interest.

| Basis | Current Deposits | Fixed Deposits |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Cheque facility | They are chequable deposits. | They are non-chequable deposits. |
| Interest payments | They do not carry any interest. | They carry interest which varies directly with the <br> period of time. |
| Number of <br> transactions | Thedepositor can make any number <br> of transactions for deposit or <br> withdrawal of money. | Depositor generally makes only two transactions; (i) <br> Deposit of Money in the beginning; (ii) Withdrawal <br> of money on maturity. |

(iii) Saving Deposits: These deposits combine features of both current account deposits and fixed deposits.

- The depositors are given cheque facility to withdraw money from their account. But, some restrictions are imposed on number and amount of withdrawals, in order to discourage the frequent use of saving deposits.
- They carry a rate of interest which is less than the interest rate on fixed deposits.

It must be noted that Current Account deposits and Saving deposits are chequable deposits, whereas Fixed deposit is a non-chequable deposit.

2. Advancing of Loans

The deposits received by banks are not allowed to remain idle. So, after keeping certain cash reserves, the balance is given to needy borrowers \& interest is charged from them. Banks charge a higher interest rate on loans than what they offer on deposits and it is the main source of income for these banks. Different types of loans \& advances made by Commercial banks are:
(i) Cash Credit: Cash credit refers to a loan given to the borrower against his current assets like shares, stocks, bonds, etc. A credit limit is sanctioned and the amount is credited in his account. The borrower may withdraw any amount within his credit limit and interest is charged on the amount actually withdrawn.
(ii) Demand Loans: Demand loans refer to those loans which can be recalled on demand by the bank at any time. The entire sum of demand loan is credited to the account and interest is payable on the entire sum.

(iii) Short-term Loans: They are given as personal loans against some collateral security. The money is credited to the account of borrower and the borrower can withdraw money from his account and interest is payable on the entire sum of loan granted.

Conditions for a Financial Institution to become a Bank 

The main function of commercial banks is to accept deposits and advance loans. A financial institution can be a banking institution only when it performs both the functions of 'Accepting Deposits' and 'Advancing Loans'. For example, LIC is not a bank as it does not accept chequable deposits from the public although it performs the function of lending money.

Secondary Functions

In addition to primary functions, commercial banks also perform the following secondary functions:

1. Overdraft Facility

It refers to a facility in which a customer is allowed to overdraw his current account upto an agreed limit. This facility is generally given to respectable and reliable customers for a short period. Customers have to pay interest to the bank on the amount overdrawn by them.

2. Discounting Bills of Exchange

It refers to a facility in which the holder of a bill of exchange can get the bill discounted with the bank before the maturity. After deducting the commission, bank pays the balance to the holder. On maturity, bank gets its payment from the party which had accepted the bill.

3. Agency Functions

Commercial banks also perform certain agency functions for their customers. For these services, banks charge some commission from their clients. Some of the agency functions are:
(i) Transfer of Funds: Banks provide the facility of economical and easy remittance of funds from place-to-place with the help of instruments like demand drafts, mail transfers, etc.
(ii) Collection and Payment of Various Items: Commercial banks collect cheques, bills, interest, dividends, subscriptions, rents and other periodical receipts on behalf of their customers and also make payments of taxes, insurance premium, etc. on standing instructions of their clients.
(iii) Purchase and Sale of Foreign Exchange: Some commercial banks are authorised by the central bank to deal in foreign exchange. They buy and sell foreign exchange on behalf of their customers and help in promoting international trade.
(iv) Purchase and Sale of Securities: Commercial banks buy and sell stocks and shares of private companies as well as government securities on behalf of their customers.
(v) Income Tax Consultancy: They also give advice to their customers on matters relating to income tax and even prepare their income tax returns.
(vi) Trustee and Executor: Commercial banks preserve the wills of their customers as trustees and execute them after their death as executors.
(vii) Letters of Reference: They give information about the economic position of their customers to traders and provide the similar information about other traders to their customers.

4. General Utility Functions

Commercial banks render some general utility services like:
(i) Locker Facility: Commercial banks provide facility of safety vaults or lockers to keep valuable articles of customers in safe custody.
(ii) Traveller's Cheques: Commercial banks issue traveller's cheques to their customers to avoid the risk of taking cash during their journey.
(iii) Letter of Credit: They also issue letters of credit to their customers to certify their creditworthiness.
(iv) Underwriting Securities: Commercial banks also undertake the task of underwriting securities. As the public has full faith in the creditworthiness of banks, the public does not hesitate to buy the securities underwritten by banks.
(v) Collection of Statistics: Banks collect and publish statistics relating to trade, commerce and industry. Hence, they advise customers on financial matters.
Commercial banks receive deposits from the public and use these deposits to give loans. However, loans offered are many times more than the deposits received by banks. This function of banks is known as 'Money Creation'.

6.3 MONEY CREATION OR CREDIT CREATION 

It is one of the most important activities of commercial banks. Through the process of money creation, commercial banks are able to create credit, which is in far excess of the initial or Primary Deposits. This process can be better understood by making two assumptions:
(i) The entire commercial banking system is one unit and is termed as 'Banks'.
(ii) All receipts and payments in the economy are routed through the Banks, i.e. all payments are made through cheques and all receipts are deposited in the banks.
The deposits held by Banks are used for giving loans. Commercial banks grant loan to the borrower by opening a deposit account in the name of the borrower and credit the loan amount in this account. This is called Secondary Deposit. However, banks cannot use the whole of deposit for lending. It is legally compulsory for the banks to keep a certain minimum fraction of their deposits as reserves. The fraction is called the Legal Reserve Ratio (LRR) or Reserve Deposit Ratio or Reserve Ratio (RR) and is fixed by the central bank. Banks do not keep $100 \%$ reserves against the deposits. They keep reserves only to the extent indicated by the Central Bank.

Primary Deposits Vs Secondary Deposits

Primary Deposits are the cash deposits of the people with the Commercial Banks in different deposit account such as saving accounts, current accounts, term deposit accounts and other deposits. On the banks to the people.

- Sum total of Primary \& Secondary Deposits is equal to total demand deposits of the Commercial Banks. Secondary Deposits indicate borrowings of the depositors with the banks, while
- Commercial banks can create secondary deposits by way of loans many times more than their cash reserves. So, secondary deposits are always more than primary deposits.

why only Fraction of deposits are kept as Cash Reserves?
Banks keep a fraction of deposits as Cash Reserves because a prudent banker, by his experience, knows two things:
(i) All the depositors do not approach the banks for withdrawal of money at the same time and also they do not withdraw the entire amount in one go.
(ii) There is a constant flow of new deposits into the banks.

So, to meet the daily demand for withdrawal of cash, it is sufficient for banks to keep only a fraction of deposits as cash reserve. It means, if experience of the banks show that withdrawals are generally around $20 \%$ of the deposits, then it needs to keep only $20 \%$ of deposits as cash reserves (LRR).

Let us now understand the process of Money Creation through an example:

- Suppose, initial or primary deposits in banks is $₹ 1,000$ and LRR is $20 \%$. It means, banks are required to keep only ₹ 200 as cash reserve and are free to lend ₹ 800 . Suppose they lend ₹ 800 . Banks do not lend this money by giving amount in cash. Rather, they open the accounts in the names of borrowers, who are free to withdraw the amount whenever they like.
- Suppose borrowers withdraw the entire amount of ₹ 800 for making payments. As all the transactions are routed through the banks, the money spent by the borrowers comes back into the banks in the form of deposit accounts of those who have received this payment. It will increase the demand deposits of banks by ₹ 800 .
- With new deposits of ₹ 800 , banks keep $20 \%$ as cash reserves and lend the balance ₹ 640. Borrowers use these loans for making payments, which again comes back into the accounts of those who have received the payments. This time, banks deposits rise by ₹ 640 .
- The deposits keep on increasing in each round by $80 \%$ of the last round deposits. At the same time, cash reserves also go on increasing, each time by $80 \%$ of the last cash reserve. Deposit creation comes to end when total cash reserves become equal to the initial deposit.

Refer the following table:

|  | Deposits (₹) | Loans (₹) | Cash Reserves (₹) (LRR = 20\%) |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Initial Deposit | 1,000 | 800 | 200 |
| Round I | 800 | 640 | 160 |
| Round II | 640 | 512 | 128 |
| - | - | - | - |
| - | - | - | - |
| - | - | - | - |
| Total | 5,000 | 4,000 | 1,000 |

As seen in the table, banks are able to create total deposits of ₹ 5,000 with the initial deposit of just ₹ 1,000 . It means, total deposits become 'five times' of the initial deposit. Five times is nothing but the value of 'Money Multiplier'.

Money Multiplier or Credit Multiplier or Deposit Multiplier 

Money multiplier is the number by which total deposits can increase due to a given change in deposits. It is inversely related to legal reserve ratio. In other words, Money Multiplier is the process by

which the commercial banks create credit, based upon the reserve ratio and initial deposits, is calculated as:

Money Multiplier or Credit Multiplier or Deposit Multiplier $=\frac{1}{\text { LRR }}$
In the given example, LRR is $20 \%$ or 0.2 . So,

$$
\text { Money Multiplier }=\frac{1}{0.2}=5
$$

It signifies that for every unit of money kept as reserves, banks are able to create 5 units of money. The value of money multiplier is determined by LRR. Higher the value of LRR, lower is the value of money multiplier and less money is created by the banking system.

For Better Clarification 

Example: Calculate the total credit creation if initial deposit is of ₹ 1,000 crores and LRR is $12.5 \%$. Solution: Given, LRR is $12.5 \%$ or 0.125

$$
\text { Money Multiplier }=\frac{1}{\text { LRR }}=\frac{1}{0.125}=8
$$

Initial Deposit $=\mathfrak{\$ 1 , 0 0 0}$ crores
Total Credit Creation = Initial Deposits $\times$ Money Multiplier $=1,000 \times 8=\mathfrak{\$ 8 , 0 0 0}$ crores ${ }^{\#}$
${ }^{\text {® }}$ It must be noted that this is the maximum amount of credit which the Commercial Banks can create, given their cash reserves because Commercial Banks are bound to comply with the LRR determined by the RBL.

FORMULAE ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT CREATION

(i) Money Multiplier or Credit Multiplier or Deposit Multiplier $=\frac{1}{\text { LRR }}$
(ii) Total Credit Creation or Total Deposits Created = Initial or Primary Deposits $\times$ Money Multiplier OR

Total Credit Creation* $=$ Initial Deposits $\times \frac{1}{\text { LRR }}$
*In other words, total Credit Creation is the product of reciprocal of Reserve Ratio (LRR) and initial deposits. OR

Initial Deposits $=\frac{\text { Total Deposits }}{\text { Money Multiplier }}$
OR
Money Multiplier $=\frac{\text { Total Deposits }}{\text { Initial Deposits }}$
(iii) Total Demand Deposits of Commercial Banks = Primary Deposits + Secondary Deposits

Money Creation by Commercial Banks raises the National Income: Commercial Banks lend money mainly to investors. The rise in investment in the economy leads to rise in National Income through the multiplier effect.

6.4 CENTRAL BANK

Central Bank is an 'Apex' body that controls, operates, regulates and directs the entire banking and monetary structure of the country.
It is known as the apex (supreme) body as it occupies the top most position in the monetary and banking system of the country. All the financially developed countries have their own central

bank. India's Central Bank is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). RBI was established in April 1, 1935 under Reserve Bank of India Act passed in 1934.

Central bank is known by different names in different countries. In India, it is Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in UK as Bank of England and in USA, it is known as Federal Reserve System.

6.5 FUNCTIONS OF CENTRAL BANK 

As the Central Bank of the country, The Reserve Bank of India performs the following functions:
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Currency Authority (or Bank of Issue)

Central Bank has the sole authority for issuing currency in the country. In India, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has the sole right to issue paper currency notes (except one-rupee notes and coins, which are issued by the Ministry of Finance). The One Rupee note bears the signature of Finance Secretary, while other currency notes bear the signature of Governor of RBI.
All the currency issued by the Central Bank is its monetary liability, i.e. Central Bank is obliged to back the currency with assets** of equal value, to enhance the public confidence in paper currency.
**Assets usually consist of gold coins, gold bullions, foreign securities and domestic government's local currency securities.

Advantages of Sole Authority of Note issue with RBI

(i) It leads to uniformity in note circulation.
(ii) It gives the central bank power to influence money supply because currency with public is a part of money supply.
(iii) It enables the government to have supervision and control over the central bank with respect to issue of notes.
(iv) It ensures public faith in the currency system.
(v) It helps in stabilisation of internal and external value of currency.

Central Government is also authorised to borrow money from the Central Bank. When government incurs a deficit in its budget, it borrows from Central Bank by selling its treasury bills. When Central Bank acquires these securities, it issues new currency. This is known as 'Monetizing the Government's Debt' or 'Deficit Financing'.

Digital Rupee 

RBI revealed a concept note on digital rupee on $7^{\text {th }}$ October, 2022 and announced the launch of first Dilot for retail digital Rupee (e?-R) on $1^{\text {st }}$ December, 2022. The launch of digital rupee or e-rupee or Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) marked a new milestone for digital payments.
- It is an electronic version of physical rupee (or digital version of cash) and represents potentially a more secure and government-supported alternative to private digital currencies. - By introducing e-rupee, RBI hopes to minimise the dangers associated with digital currencies, it is a legal tender issued by the central bank, but in electronic form.
- Digital Rupee has number of advantages like efficient, quicker and cheaper money transfers, faster settlements, less transaction cost and easier carrying and storage.


Banker to the Government

The Reserve Bank of India acts as a banker, agent and a financial advisor to the Central Government and all the State Governments.
As a banker, it carries out all banking business of the government.

- It maintains a current account to keep their cash balances.
- It accepts receipts and makes payments for the government and carries out exchange, remittance and other banking operations.
- It also gives loans and advances to the government for temporary periods. The government borrows money by selling treasury bills to the Central Bank.
As an agent, the central bank also has the responsibility of managing the public debt.
As a financial advisor, the central bank advises the government from time to time on economic, financial and monetary matters.


Banker's Bank and Supervisor

There are a number of commercial banks in a country. There should be some agency to regulate and supervise their proper functioning. Being the apex bank, the central bank (RBI) acts as the banker to other banks. In this sense, it bears the same relationship with commercial banks as the latter maintains with the general public.
As the banker to banks, the central bank functions in three capacities:
(i) Custodian of Cash Reserves: Commercial banks are required to keep a certain proportion of their deposits (known as Cash Reserve Ratio or CRR) with the central bank. In this way, central bank acts as a custodian of cash reserves of commercial banks.

For 'Advantages of Centralised Cash Reserves with Central Bank', refer Power Booster.
(ii) Lender of the Last Resort: When commercial banks fail to meet their financial requirements from other sources, i.e. in case of a financial emergency, they approach the central bank to give loans and advances as lender of the last resort. Central bank assists these banks through discounting of approved securities and bills of exchange.
By offering loans to Commercial Banks in situations of emergency, Central Bank plays the role of guarantor for them and maintains a sound and healthy banking system in the economy.
(iii) Clearing House: As central bank holds the cash reserves of all the commercial banks, it becomes easier and more convenient for it to act as their clearing house. All commercial

banks have their accounts with the central bank. Therefore, the central bank can easily settle claims of various commercial banks against each other, by making debit and credit entries in their accounts.
As a supervisor, central bank regulates \& controls the commercial banks. The regulation of banks may be related to their licensing, branch expansion, liquidity of assets, management, merging, winding up, etc. The control is exercised by periodic inspection of banks \& returns filed by them.

Controller of Money Supply and Credit 

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is empowered to regulate the money supply in the economy through its 'Monetary Policy'. It is the policy adopted by the Central Bank of an economy in the direction of crodit control or money supply. As RBI has the sole monopoly in currency issue, it can control credit and supply of money. For this, RBI makes use of following instruments of Monetary Policy:

1. Repo (Repurchase) Rate: Repo rate is the rate at which the central bank of a country (RBI in case of India) lends money to commercial banks to meet their short-term needs. The central bank advances loans against approved securities or eligible bills of exchange.
An increase in repo rate increases the cost of borrowings from the central bank. It forces the commercial banks to increase their lending rates, which discourages borrowers from taking loans. It reduces the ability of commercial banks to create credit. A decrease in the repo rate will have the opposite effect.
2. Bank Rate (or Discount Rate): Bank rate is the rate at which the central bank of a country (RBI in case of India) lends money to commercial banks to meet their long-term needs.
RBI uses bank rate to control credit and it has the same effect as that of Repo rate, i.e. an increase in Bank rate increases the cost of borrowings from the central bank, which leads to increase in lending rates by commercial banks. It discourages borrowers from taking loans, which reduces the ability of commercial banks to create credit.

| Increase in Repo Rate (or Bank Rate) by RBI |  | Decrease in Repo Rate (or Bank Rate) by RBI |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| - Increases | $\rightarrow$ Cost of Borrowings for Commercial Banks |  |  |
| - Increases | $\rightarrow$ Lending Rates by Commercial Banks |  |  |
| - Discourages | $\rightarrow$ Borrowers from Taking Loans |  |  |
| - Reduces | $\rightarrow$ Credit Creating Power |  |  |
| - Reduces | $\rightarrow$ Money Supply in the Economy |  |  |

For 'Key Differences between Repo Rate and Bank Rate', refer Power Booster Section.
3. Reverse Repo Rate (or Reverse Repurchase Rate): This is the exact opposite of Repo Rate. Reverse Repo Rate is the rate of interest at which commercial banks can deposit their surplus funds with the Central Bank, for a relatively shorter period of time. So, it is the rate of interest at which the Central Bank (Reserve Bank of India) accepts deposits from the Commercial Banks.

- When the reverse repo rate is raised, it encourages the commercial banks to deposit their funds with the central bank. This has the negative effect on the lending capability of the commercial banks.

- Lowering reverse repo rate has the opposite effect, which raises demand for borrmo from the commercial banks.
During the Covid-2019, Commercial Banks were flooded with deposits from public and there were less borrowings. As a result, Commercial Banks were parking their surplus funds with RBI and getting interest in the form of reverse repo rate.


Always Remember 

Repo Rate and Reverse Repo Rate are just opposite of each other. However they are treated in the same way in controlling lending capacity of Commercial Banks. To control credit creation by Commercial Banks, both are increased, while both are reduced to enhance credit creating power of Commercial Banks.
4. Open Market Operations: Open market operations (OMO) refer to buying and selling of government securities by the Central Bank from/to the public and commercial banks. RBI is authorised to sell or purchase treasury bills and government securities. It does not matter whether the securities are bought or sold to the public or banks because ultimately the amounts will be deposited in or transferred from some bank.

- Sale of securities by central bank reduces the reserves of commercial banks. It adversely affects the bank's ability to create credit and therefore decrease the money supply in the economy.
- Purchase of securities by central bank increases the reserves and raises the bank's ability to give credit.

Sale of Securities by RBI

| - Reduces | $\rightarrow$ Cash Reserves of Commercial Banks |
| :--: | :--: |
| - Reduces | $\rightarrow$ Credit Creating Power |
| - Reduces | $\rightarrow$ Money Supply in the Economy |

Purchases of Securities by RBI

| - Increases | $\rightarrow$ Cash Reserves of Commercial Banks |
| :--: | :--: |
| - Increases | $\rightarrow$ Credit Creating Power |
| Increases | $\rightarrow$ Money Supply in the Economy |

Conditions Necessary for Success of Open Market Operations

(i) There should exist a well developed and organised security market.
(ii) The reserves of commercial banks should be affected with the sale and purchase of securities.
(iii) The central bank should hold adequate securities to influence money supply in the economy.
(iv) There should not be frequent fluctuations in the value of government securities.
5. Legal Reserve Requirements (Variable Reserve Ratio Method): According to Legal reserve requirements, commercial banks are obliged to maintain reserves. It is a very quick and direct method for controlling the credit creating power of commercial banks. Commercial Banks are required to maintain reserves on two accounts:
(i) Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR): It refers to the minimum percentage of net demand and timit liabilities, to be kept by commercial banks with the central bank. A change in CRR afficts the ability of commercial banks to create the credit. For instance, an increase in CRR reduces the excess reserves of commercial banks and limits their credit creating power.

(ii) Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR): It refers to a minimum percentage of net demand and time liabilities which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves. SLR unencumbered*, government and other approved** securities or current account balances with other banks. Change in SLR affects the freedom of banks to sell government securities or borrow against them from the Central Bank. An increase in SLR reduces the ability of banks to give credit and vice-versa.
The Reserve Bank can influence the credit creation power of the banks by making changes in CRR or/and SLR.

* Unencumbered securities refer to those securities which are not acting as security for loans from Central Bank. ** Approved securities refer to those securities whose repayment is guaranteed by the government.

6. Margin Requirements: Margin is the difference between the amount of loan and market value of the security offered by the borrower against the loan. If the margin fixed by the Central Bank is $40 \%$, then commercial banks are allowed to give a loan only up to $60 \%$ of the value of security. By changing the margin requirements, the Reserve Bank can alter the amount of loans made against securities by the banks.

- An increase in margin reduces the borrowing capacity and money supply.
- A fall in margin encourages the people to borrow more.
- RBI may prescribe different margins for different type of borrowers against the security of the same commodity.
- Margin is necessary because if a bank gives a loan equal to the full value of security, then bank will suffer a loss in case of fall in price of security.


Other Instruments of Credit Control 

1. Moral Suasion: This is a combination of persuasion and pressure that Central Bank applies on other banks in order to get them act, in a manner, in line with its policy. Moral suasion is exercised through discussions, letters, speeches and hints to banks. The Reserve Bank frequently announces its policy position and urges the banks to cooperate in implementing its credit policies. Moral suasion can be used for both quantitative as well as qualitative credit control.
Generally, central bank succeeds in convincing the banks as it acts as their lender of last resort. However, no punitive action is taken in case they do not follow the advice or request.
2. Selective Credit Controls: Under selective credit controls, the RBI gives directions to other banks to give or not to give credit for certain purposes to particular sectors. This method can be applied in both positive and negative manner. In positive manner, it means using measures to channelise credit to priority sectors. The priority sector includes small-scale industry, agriculture, exports, etc. In negative manner, it means using measures to restrict flow of credit to particular sectors.

Credit Control Instruments of RBI: Quantitative Vs Qualitative Instruments

The central bank (Reserve Bank of India) controls credit through the various methods, which are also categorised as 'Quantitative' and 'Qualitative' methods:

* Quantitative methods include repo rate policy, bank rate policy, reverse repo rate policy, open market operations, varying reserve requirements. Qualitative methods include margin requirements, moral suasion, selective credit controls.
(Cont...)

(Cont...)
- Quantitative instruments are general in nature and it affects all the sectors making use of bank However, qualitative instruments are specific in nature, i.e. they affect the flow of credit for a particular use.
- Quantitative controls are designed to regulate the total volume of credit, whereas, qualitative control are designed to regulate the direction of credit.
- Quantitative methods are also known as traditional methods of control and qualitative methods also known as selective methods of control.

Custodian of Foreign Exchange Reserves 

The central bank also acts as the custodian of the country's stock of gold and reserves of foreign exchange. This function enables the central bank to exercise a reasonable control on foreign exchange. According to regulations of foreign exchange, all foreign exchange transactions must be routed through RBI. Centralisation of foreign exchange transactions with the Reserve Bank serves two objectives:
(i) It helps the bank in stabilizing the external value of currency;
(ii) It helps in pursuing a coordinated policy towards the balance of payments situation of the country.

6.6 CENTRAL BANK Vs COMMERCIAL BANK

The various points of differences between the Central Bank and Commercial Bank are:

| Basis | Central Bank | Commercial Bank |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Meaning | Central bank is an apex body that controls, operates, regulates and directs the entire banking and monetary structure of the country. | Commercial bank is an institution which performs the functions of accepting deposits, granting loans and making investments with the objective of earning profits. |
| Status | It is the apex institution in the money market. | It is merely a unit in the banking structure of the country and operates under the control of central bank. |
| Ownership | It is generally owned and governed by the government. | It can be owned and governed by the government or the private sector. |
| Objective | It operates in public interest without profit motive. | It aims to maximise profits. |
| Issue of currency | It has sole monopoly in issue of currency. | It has no power to issue currency. |
| Public dealing | It does not deal directly with the public. | It deals directly with the public. |
| Number of Banks | There is only one central bank in a country due to peculiar nature of its activities. For example, RBI in India. | There are a number of commercial banks in a country. For example, State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, etc. in India. |

PIOIRIR:BIOISFIRR 

1. ROLE AND IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCIAL BANKS

The functions of commercial banks explain their importance in the economic development of a country. Banks help in accelerating the economic growth of a country in the following ways:

1. Accelerating the Rate of Capital Formation: Commercial banks encourage the habit of thrift and mobilise the savings of people. These savings are effectively allocated among the ultimate users of funds, i.e., investors for productive investment. So, savings of people result in capital formation which forms the basis of economic development.
2. Provision of Finance and Credit: Commercial banks are a very important source of finance and credit for trade and industry. The activities of commercial banks are not only confined to domestic trade and commerce, but extend to foreign trade also.
3. Developing Entrepreneurship: Banks promote entrepreneurship by underwriting the shares of new and existing companies and granting assistance in promoting new ventures or financing promotional activities. Banks finance sick (loss-making) industries for making them viable units.
4. Promoting Balanced Regional Development: Commercial banks provide credit facilities to rural people by opening branches in the backward areas. The funds collected in developed regions may be channelised for investments in the under developed regions of the country. In this way, they bring about more balanced regional development.
5. Help to Consumers: Commercial banks advance credit for purchase of durable consumer items like Vehicles, T.V., refrigerator etc., which are out of reach for some consumers due to their limited paying capacity. In this way, banks help in creating demand for such consumer goods.

2. STRUCTURE OF COMMERCIAL BANKS IN INDIA

The commercial banks can be broadly classified under two heads:
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

1. Scheduled Commercial Banks: Scheduled Commercial Banks refer to those banks which have been included in the Second Schedule of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. In India, scheduled commercial banks are of three types:
(i) Private Sector Banks: These banks are owned and controlled by private businessmen. Their main objective is to earn profits. ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank are some examples of private sector banks.
(ii) Public Sector Banks: These banks are owned and controlled by the government. The main objective of these banks is to provide service to the society, not to make profits. State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank and Corporation Bank are some examples of public sector banks. Public sector banks are of two types: (a) SBI and its subsidiaries; (b) Other nationalized banks.
(iii) Foreign Sector Banks: These banks are owned and controlled by foreign promoters. Their number has grown rapidly since 1991, when the process of economic liberalization had started in India. Bank of America, American Express Bank, Standard Chartered Bank are examples of foreign sector banks.
2. Non-Scheduled Commercial Banks: Non-Scheduled Commercial Banks refer to those banks which are not included in the Second Schedule of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.

3. ADVANTAGES OF CENTRALISED CASH RESERVES WITH CENTRAL BANK 

The main advantages are:
(i) This system results in effective utilisation of the cash reserves of the country.
(ii) It reinforces the confidence of public in the strength of the banking system of the country.
(iii) It enables the central bank to control credit creation (done by commercial banks) by changing the cash reserve requirement.
(iv) Commercial banks can get financial help from the central bank during temporary difficulties.

However, centralised reserve system is not favoured by commercial banks because it reduces their liquid funds and such reserves do not carry any interest.

4. KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPO RATE AND BANK RATE

The main differences are:
