3.1 INTRODUCTION

National Income is an important concept of macroeconomics. There are various aggregates or variants of national income. Each aggregate has a specific meaning, method of measurement and use. The various aggregates of national income are:

1. Gross Domestic Product at Market Price $\left(\mathrm{GDP}_{\mathrm{MP}}\right)$
2. Gross Domestic Product at Factor Cost $\left(\mathrm{GDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}\right)$
3. Net Domestic Product at Market Price $\left(\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{MP}}\right)$
4. Net Domestic Product at Factor Cost ( $\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$ or Domestic Income)
5. Gross National Product at Market Price $\left(\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}\right)$
6. Gross National Product at Factor Cost $\left(\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}\right)$
7. Net National Product at Market Price $\left(\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}\right)$
8. Net National Product at Factor Cost ( $\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$ or National Income)

3.2 BASIC AGGREGATES OF NATIONAL INCOME

In an economy, various goods and services are produced by different productive units during a period of one year. Such goods and services cannot be added together in terms of quantity (as we cannot add 5,000 tonnes of wheat +10,000 mobile phones $+7,000$ machines and so on). Therefore, these are expressed in terms of money.
There are many aggregates in national income to measure the value of goods and services in terms of money. Let us start with Gross Domestic Product at Market Price (GDP ${ }_{\text {MP }}$ ).

Gross Domestic Product at Market Price (GDP ${ }_{\text {MP }}$ )

It refers to gross market value of all final goods and services produced within the domestic territory of a country during a period of one year.

- 'Gross' in GDP ${ }_{\text {MP }}$ signifies that no provision has been made for depreciation, i.e. it includes depreciation.
- 'Domestic' in GDP ${ }_{\text {MP }}$ signifies that it includes goods and services produced by all units located within the domestic territory (irrespective of fact whether produced by residents or non-residents).
- 'Market Price' in GDP ${ }_{\text {MP }}$ signifies that it includes amount of indirect taxes paid \& excludes amount of subsidy received, i.e. it shows that net indirect taxes (NIT) have been included.
- 'Product' in GDP ${ }_{\text {MP }}$ signifies that only final goods and services have to be included.

By making adjustments in GDP $_{\text {MP }}$, we can derive other aggregates.

Gross Domestic Product at Factor Cost (GDP ${ }_{\text {FC }}$ ) 

It refers to gross money value of all the final goods and services produced within the domestic territory of a country during a period of one year.

$$
\mathrm{GDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathrm{GDP}_{\mathrm{MP}}-\text { Net Indirect Taxes }
$$

Net Domestic Product at Market Price (NDP ${ }_{\text {MP }}$ )

It refers to net market value of all the final goods and services produced within the domestic territory of a country during a period of one year.

$$
\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{MP}}=\mathrm{GDP}_{\mathrm{MP}}-\text { Depreciation }
$$

Net Domestic Product at Factor Cost (NDP ${ }_{\text {FC }}$ )

It refers to net money value of all the final goods and services produced within the domestic territory of a country during a period of one year.

$$
\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathrm{GDP}_{\mathrm{MP}}-\text { Net Indirect Taxes }- \text { Depreciation }
$$

NDP $_{\text {FC }}$ is also known as Domestic Income or Domestic factor income.

Relationship between Four Domestic Concepts

GDP $_{\text {MP }}$, GDP $_{\text {FC }}$, NDP $_{\text {MP }}$ and NDP $_{\text {FC }}$ are four Domestic concepts. The term 'Domestic'signifies that contribution of only those producers (whether resident or non-resident) is to be included who are within the domestic territory of the country.

Gross National Product at Market Price (GNP ${ }_{\text {MP }}$ )

It refers to gross market value of all the final goods and services produced by the normal residents of a country during a period of one year.

GNP $_{\text {MP }}=$ GDP $_{\text {MP }}+$ Net factor income from abroad
It must be noted that GNP $_{\text {MP }}$ can be less than GDP $_{\text {MP }}$ when NFIA is negative. However, GNP $_{\text {MP }}$ will be more than GDP $_{\text {MP }}$ when NFIA is positive.

Gross National Product at Factor Cost (GNP ${ }_{\text {FC }}$ ) 

It refers to gross money value of all the final goods and services produced by the normal residents of a country during a period of one year.

$$
\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}-\text { Net Indirect Taxes }
$$

Net National Product at Market Price (NNP ${ }_{\text {MP }}$ )

It refers to net market value of all the final goods and services produced by the normal residents of a country during a period of one year.

$$
\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}=\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}-\text { Depreciation }
$$

Net National Product at Factor Cost (NNP ${ }_{\text {FC }}$ )

It refers to net money value of all the final goods and services produced by the normal residents of a country during a period of one year.

$$
\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}-\text { Net Indirect Taxes }- \text { Depreciation }
$$

It must be noted that $\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$ is also known as National Income.

Relationship between Four National Concepts

GNP $_{\text {MP }}$, GNP $_{\text {FC }}$, NNP $_{\text {MP }}$ and NNP $_{\text {FC }}$ are four National concepts. The term 'National' signifies that production of only normal residents of the country is to be included even if they are outside the domestic territory of the country.

Domestic Income (NDP ${ }_{\text {FC }}$ ) Vs National Income (NNP ${ }_{\text {FC }}$ )

| Basis | Domestic Income (NDP ${ }_{\text {FC }}$ ) | National Income (NNP ${ }_{\text {FC }}$ ) |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Nature of Concept | It is a territorial concept as it includes the value of final goods and services produced within domestic territory of a country. | It is a national concept as it includes the value of final goods \& services produced in the entire world. |
| Category of Producers | It considers all producers within the domestic territory of the country. | It considers all producers who are normal residents of the country. |
| NFIA | It does not include NFIA. | It includes NFIA. |

As discussed in Chapter 1, 'Closed Economy' is an economy which has no economic relations with rest of the world. In a Closed Economy, there is no difference between Domestic Income and National Income, i.e. Domestic Income $=$ National Income.

Steps for Calculating Practicals of Basic Aggregates of National Income 

There are eight basic aggregates of National Income:

| 4 Domestic Concepts : | GDP $_{\text {MP }}$ | GDP $_{\text {FC }}$ | NDP $_{\text {MP }}$ | NDP $_{\text {FC }}$ |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 4 National Concepts : | GNP $_{\text {MP }}$ | GNP $_{\text {FC }}$ | NNP $_{\text {MP }}$ | NNP $_{\text {FC }}$ |

While solving practicals of National Income, we are often required to calculate one of the basic aggregate out of the other 7 aggregates. For better understanding of the steps, let us assume that we have to calculate $\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$ from $\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}$ :

The various steps are:
Step 1. Formulate an equation by putting 'Aggregate to be calculated on the left hand side' and 'Aggregate given on the right hand side'.
Considering the given example, the equation will be: $\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}} \pm$ Adjustments.

Step 2. Identify the 'Adjustments' and calculate the answer.
As we have to calculate NDP $_{\mathrm{FC}}$ from $\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}$, there are three adjustments required:

- 'G' in $\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}$ signifies Gross, i.e. it includes depreciation. So, Depreciation will be subtracted from $\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}$ to arrive at $\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}$
- ' $\boldsymbol{N}$ ' in $\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}$ signifies National, i.e. it includes Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA). So, NFIA will be subtracted from NNP $_{\text {MP }}$ to arrive at $\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{MP}}$
- 'MP' in GNP $_{\text {MP }}$ signifies Market Price, i.e. it includes Net Indirect Taxes (NIT). So, NIT will be subtracted from $\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{MP}}$ to arrive at $\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$
The equation will become: $\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}-$ Depreciation - NFIA - NIT. After putting the respective values of $\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}$, Depreciation, NFIA and NIT, we can calculate $\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$
Let us understand this with the help of following illustrations:
Illustration 1. Calculate NDP at FC.

| Particulars | In crores |
| :-- | :--: |
| (i) GNP at MP | 8,000 |
| (ii) Depreciation | 600 |
| (iii) Net Factor Income from Abroad | 300 |
| (iv) Net Indirect taxes | 700 |

Solution: 

In the given question, $\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$ is to be calculated from $\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}$. It can be calculated through following steps:
Step 1. Formulate an equation by putting ' $\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$ on the left hand side' and ' $\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}$ on the right hand side'. $\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}} \pm$ Adjustments
Step 2. Identify the 'Adjustments' and calculate the answer.
Depreciation, Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA) and Net Indirect taxes (NIT) will be subtracted from GNP $_{\text {MP }}$ to arrive at $\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}} & =\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}-\text { Depreciation }- \text { NFIA }- \text { NIT } \\
& =8,000-600-300-700 \\
\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}} & =\mathbb{4}, 400 \text { crores. }
\end{aligned}
$$

| :-- | :-- | --: |
| (i) NNP at FC | 2,000 |  |
| (ii) Depreciation | 200 |  |
| (iii) Subsidies | 70 |  |
| (iv) Factor Income from Abroad | 110 |  |
| (v) Indirect Taxes | 180 |  |
| (vi) Factor Income to Abroad | 50 |  |

Solution:

In the given question, GDP $_{\text {MP }}$ is to be calculated from $\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$. It can be calculated through following steps:
Step 1. Formulate an equation by putting 'GDP $_{\text {MP }}$ on the left hand side' and 'NNP $_{\text {FC }}$ on the right hand side'. $\mathrm{GDP}_{\mathrm{MP}}=\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{FC}} \pm$ Adjustments

Step 2. Identify the 'Adjustments' and calculate the answer.
Depreciation and Net Indirect taxes (NIT) will be added while Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA) will be subtracted from $\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$ to arrive at GDP $\mathrm{g}_{\mathrm{MP}}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { GDP }_{\mathrm{MP}}=\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}+\text { Depreciation }-\mathrm{NFIA}^{\star}+\mathrm{NIT}^{\#} \\
& =2,000+200-(110-50)+(180-70) \\
& \text { GDP }_{\mathrm{MP}}=\mathbb{2}, 250 \text { crores. } \\
& \text { Note: NFIA }^{\star}=\text { Factor Income from Abroad - Factor Income to Abroad; } \\
& \text { NIT }^{\#}=\text { Indirect Taxes - Subsidies }
\end{aligned}

| (i) | GNP at MP | 6,000 |
| (ii) | Subsidies | 200 |
| (iii) | Depreciation | 100 |
| (iv) | Net Factor income from abroad | 400 |
| (v) | Indirect tax | 300 |

Solution:

NDP at FC
= GNP at MP - Depreciation - Net Factor income from abroad - (Indirect tax - Subsidies)
$=6,000-100-400-(300-200)=\mathbb{5}, 400$ crores
Ans. NDP at FC $=\mathbb{4} 5,400$ crores
The Solution of Example 1 can also be presented as:
$=(\mathrm{i})-(\mathrm{iii})-(\mathrm{iv})-((\mathrm{v})-(\mathrm{ii}))=6,000-100-400-(300-200)=\mathbb{5}, 400$ crores
Ans. NDP at FC $=\mathbb{4} 5,400$ crores

Example 2. Calculate National Income or NNP at FC.

| (iv) Factor income from abroad | 150 |  |
| (v) Subsidies | 70 |  |
| (vi) Factor income to abroad | 250 |  |

Solution: 

National Income or NNP at FC
= GDP at MP - Consumption of Fixed Capital + (Factor income from abroad - Factor income to abroad)

- (Goods and Services Tax - Subsidies)
$=5,500-300+(150-250)-(120-70)=₹ 5,050$ crores
Ans. NNP at FC = ₹ 5,050 crores
Example 3. Calculate GNP at FC.

| Particulars | In crores |  |
| :-- | :-- | --: |
| (i) NDP at MP | 25,000 |  |

| (iii) Subsidies | 30 |  |
| (iv) Factor income from abroad | 400 |  |
| (v) Factor income to abroad | 600 |  |

Solution:

Note: In the given example, only subsidies are given. There can be two ways to solve this:
(i) Add subsidies (as factor cost is to be calculated from the market price); or
(ii) Write formula as: (Indirect taxes - Subsidies) and put value of indirect taxes as zero.

GNP at FC
= NDP at MP + Depreciation + (Factor income from abroad - Factor income to abroad) + Subsidies
$=25,000+5,000+(400-600)+30=\$ 29,830$ crores
The Solution can also be presented as:
= NDP at MP + Depreciation + (Factor income from abroad - Factor income to abroad) - (Indirect tax - Subsidies)
$=25,000+5,000+(400-600)-(0-30)=₹ 29,830$ crores
Ans. GNP at FC = ₹ 29,830 crores

| :-- | :-- | --: |
| (i) National Income or NNP at FC | 4,000 |  |
| (ii) GDP at MP | 5,000 |  |
| (iii) Net Indirect Tax | 300 |  |
| (iv) Net Factor income from abroad | 200 |  |

Solution: 

GDP at MP = NNP at FC + Consumption of Fixed Capital - Net Factor income from abroad + Net Indirect Tax
$5,000=4,000+$ Consumption of Fixed Capital $-200+300$
Consumption of Fixed Capital $=5,000-4,000+200-300=\$ 900$ crores
Ans. Consumption of Fixed Capital $=\$ 900$ crores
Example 6. From the following data, estimate the value of Net Indirect Taxes (NIT):
(CBSE, 2024 (58/5/1))

| Particulars | In crores |
| :-- | :--: |
| (i) Net National Product at Market Price $\left(\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{MP}}\right)$ | 1,400 |

| (iv) Factor income from abroad | 400 |  |
| (v) NDP at MP | 24,000 |  |
| (vi) Factor income to abroad | 600 |  |

Solution:

GNP at FC = NDP at MP + Consumption of Fixed Capital + (Factor Income from abroad - Factor income to abroad) - (Indirect Taxes - Subsidies)
$27,710=24,000+4,000+(400-600)-(120-$ Subsidies $)$
Subsidies $=27,710-24,000-4,000-(400-600)+120=\$ 30$ crores
Ans. Subsidies $=\$ 30$ crores
Example 8. Calculate Factor Income to abroad.

| :-- | :-- |
| (v) Factor Income from abroad | 700 |
| (vi) NDP at FC | 3,900 |

Solution: 

GNP at MP = NDP at FC + Replacement of Fixed Capital + (Factor Income from abroad - Factor Income to abroad) + (Indirect Taxes - Subsidies)
$4,500=3,900+100+(700-$ Factor Income to abroad $)+(300-200)$
Factor Income to abroad $=3,900+100+700+(300-200)-4,500=\mathbb{\pi} 300$ crores
Ans. Factor Income to abroad $=\mathbb{3} 300$ crores
Note: Replacement of Fixed Capital is another name for Depreciation.
Example 9. The net domestic product at market price of an economy is ₹ 4,500 crores. The capital stock is worth ₹ 4,000 crores and it depreciates at the rate of $10 \%$ per annum. Indirect taxes amount to ₹ 150 crores, subsidies amount to ₹ 20 crores, factor income from the rest of the world is ₹ 400 crores and to rest of the world is ₹ 600 crores. Find out the gross national product at factor cost.

Solution:

Gross National Product at Factor Cost $\left(\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}\right)$
= Net Domestic Product at Market Price + Depreciation - Net Indirect taxes + Net Factor income from abroad $=4,500+10 \%$ of $4,000-(150-20)+(400-600)=4,500+400-130-200=\mathbb{\pi} 4,570$ crores
Ans. Gross National Product at Factor Cost $\left(\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}\right)=\mathbb{4}, 570$ crores
Example 10. Calculate (a) Depreciation; (b) Subsidies; (c) NDP at FC.

CATEGORISATION OF DOMESTIC INCOME

The domestic income $\left(\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}\right)$ of a country is earned by both private sector and public sector. So, it is sub-divided into two parts:

1. Income from domestic product accruing to Private Sector: It refers to that part of domestic income which accrues only to the private sector.
2. Income from domestic product accruing to Public Sector: It refers to that part of domestic income which accrues to the public or government sector. It further includes two components:
(i) Income from property and entrepreneurship accruing to government administrative departments: It includes income earned by Government's departmental enterprises (like railways, posts and telegraphs, etc.) from property (rent and interest) and entrepreneurship (profit).
(ii) Savings of non-departmental enterprises: It includes undistributed profits of nondepartmental government enterprises (like Air India, MTNL, LIC, etc.).
Income from Domestic Product accruing to Private Sector
$=\mathrm{NDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$ - Income from Property and Entrepreneurship accruing to Government Administrative Departments - Savings of Non-departmental Enterprises.

PRIVATE INCOME

Private income refers to the income which accrues to private sector from all the sources within and outside the country.
It includes both earned income (factor income) and unearned income (transfer income) received by private sector (Private enterprises + Households). It means, it consists of two kinds of incomes:

1. Factor Income (Earned Income): There are two sources of factor income for the Private sector:
(i) Income earned within the domestic territory known as Income from domestic product accruing to private sector.
(ii) Income earned outside the domestic territory known as Net factor income from abroad.
2. Transfer Income (Unearned Income): The transfer income is also received from two sources:
(i) Income received within the domestic territory. It includes National debt interest and current transfers from government.
(ii) Income received from outside the domestic territory known as net current transfers from the rest of the world.

It must be noted that Net factor income from abroad (NFIA) accrues to both Private and Government sectors. However, due to lack of data for the Government sector, it is assumed that NFIA is attributed to the Private Sector only.

Transfer Incomes under Private Income 

(i) Interest on National Debt: Sometimes, the government borrows funds from the public to issuing bonds like National Saving Certificates, Saving Bonds, etc.) in order to meet its resen expenditure. Such debts are generally used by the government for consumption purposes Hence, interest paid on such debts is treated as a transfer income for private enterprises.
(ii) Current transfers from Government: It includes all transfer receipts from government in the form of scholarships, unemployment allowances, subsidies, etc. Such transfers are always positive as they are one-sided, i.e., they flow from Government to the private sector.
(iii) Net Current transfers from rest of the world: It refers to net gifts and remittances received from abroad. It is positive when transfers received from abroad are more than transfers paid abroad. However, if transfers paid abroad are more than transfers received, then it is negative.

Private Income Vs National Income

| Basis | Private Income | National Income |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Factor/Transfer <br> Income | It includes factor incomes as well as <br> transfer incomes. | It includes factor incomes only. |
| Public Sector Income | It does not include income of public <br> sector. | It includes the income of public sector. |

Private Income Vs Income from Domestic Product accruing to Private Sector

| Basis | Private Income | Income from Domestic Product <br> accruing to Private Sector |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Factor/Transfer <br> Income | It includes factor incomes as well as <br> transfer incomes. | It includes factor incomes only. |
| Concept | It is a national concept as it includes NFIA. | It is a domestic concept as it excludes <br> NFIA. |

PERSONAL INCOME

Personal Income is the sum total of all the incomes that are actually received by households from all the sources. Like private income, it also includes both factor and transfer incomes.

Personal Income does not include 'Corporate Tax' and 'Retained Earnings'

Private income belongs to both private enterprises and the households. However, Personal Income refers to that part of private income, which is received by the households only.

- Personal Income does not include 'Corporate Tax' as such taxes are paid by the private enterprises to the Government and are not received by the households.
- Personal Income does not include 'Retained Earnings' also as they are retained by private enterprises for their future expansion and unforeseen events.

Personal Income = Private Income - Corporate Tax - Retained Earnings.

Personal Income Vs Private Income

| Basis | Personal Income | Private Income |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Meaning | It refers to income actually received by <br> households from all sources. | It refers to the income which accrues to <br> private sector from all sources. |
| Concept | It is a narrower concept as it is a part of <br> private income. | It is a broader concept as it includes <br> personal income. |
| Formula | Personal Income $=$ Private Income - <br> Corporate Tax - Retained earnings. | Private Income $=$ Personal Income + <br> Corporate Tax + Retained earnings. |

Personal Income Vs National Income

| Basis | Personal Income | National Income |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Meaning | It is the sum total of all incomes that are <br> actually received by households from all <br> the sources. | National Income refers to the sum total <br> of all the factor incomes, earned by the <br> normal residents of a country during a <br> period of one year. |
| Nature of Income | It includes both factor incomes as well as <br> transfer incomes. | It includes only the factor incomes. |
| Public sector income | It does not include income earned by <br> public sector. | It includes income earned by public <br> sector. |

PERSONAL DISPOSABLE INCOME 

Personal Disposable Income (PDY) refers to that part of personal income which is actually available at the disposal of households.
It is that part of personal income which is left with the households after making payments of taxes, fees and other miscellaneous receipts of the government.

PDY excludes 'Personal Taxes' and 'Miscellaneous Receipts of Government'

Personal Income shows the total income received by households from all sources. However, PDY is that part of personal income which the households can spend the way they like, i.e. it shows the purchasing power of the households. Therefore, PDY excludes that part of personal income which is paid to the government.

- PDY does not include 'Personal Taxes' as households need to pay direct taxes like income tax, house tax, etc. to the Government
- PDY does not include 'Miscellaneous Receipts of Government' as these are small compulsory payments made by households to the government in the form of fees, fines, etc.
Personal Disposable Income $=$ Personal Income - Personal taxes - Miscellaneous receipts of government.


One More way to Calculate PDY

Households can use their personal disposable income by either spending on consumption of goods and services or saving for the future. So, PDY can also be calculated as:

Personal Disposable Income $=$ Personal Consumption Expenditure + Personal Savings

After understanding the concept of personal disposable income, let us now discuss the meaning of National Disposable Income.

NATIONAL DISPOSABLE INCOME (NET AND GROSS) 

National Disposable Income (NDY) refers to the income which is available to the whole country for disposal. It includes both factor income and transfer income. It is also known as 'Net National Disposable Income'.

NDY includes 'Net Indirect Taxes' and 'Net Current Transfers from ROW'

NDY shows the total income available with the economy at its disposal from all sources. It means

- NDY includes 'Net Indirect Taxes' as it is the transfer income of the government and is free to use it, the way it likes.
- NDY also includes 'Net Current Transfers from ROW' as it is the transfer income of the government received from abroad.
National Disposable Income = National Income + Net indirect taxes + Net current transfers from the rest of the world


One More way to Calculate NDY

NDY is the maximum income available to a country to spend on consumption of goods or services and savings. So, NDY can also be calculated as:

NDY = National Consumption Expenditure + National Savings
National Consumption Expenditure is the sum total of 'Private Final Consumption Expenditure' and 'Government Final Consumption Expenditure.'

Gross National Disposable Income

When depreciation is added to the net National Disposable Income, we get Gross National Disposable Income.

Gross National Disposable Income = Net National Disposable Income + Depreciation
