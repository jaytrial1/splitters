4.1 INTRODUCTION

National Income is considered as the most comprehensive measure of the performance of an economy. However, its measurement is an extremely complicated task.

- When the process of production takes place, then the factor incomes are paid to factors of production for their factor services. It means, there is an 'Income Flow' corresponding to the 'Output Flow'.
- Factors of production spend their income on purchase of goods and services by making consumption 'Expenditure'.
Thus, production gives rise to income, income results in expenditure, which in turn, generates income again.

Similarly, National Income of a country can be measured by 3 different methods:

1. Value Added Method
2. Income Method
3. Expenditure Method

We have three different methods to measure the national income because production, income and expenditure are three different phases of circular flow of income. Use of a particular method depends on the availability of reliable data.

It must be noted that all three methods give the same value of national income because they are used to measure the same physical output at three different phases. In India, the task of estimating national income is entrusted with the National Statistical Office (NSO).

4.2 VALUE ADDED METHOD 

This method is used to measure national income in different phases of production in the circular flow. It shows the contribution (value added) of each producing unit in the production process.

- Every individual enterprise adds a certain value to the products, which it purchases from some other firm as intermediate goods.
- When value added by each and every individual firm is summed up, we get the value of national income.
Value Added Method is also known as: (i) Product Method; (ii) Inventory Method; (iii) Net Output Method; (iv) Industrial Origin Method; and (v) Commodity Service Method.


Concept of Value Added

Value added refers to the addition of value to the raw material (intermediate goods) by a firm, by virtue of its productive activities. It is the contribution of an enterprise to the current flow of goods \& services. It is calculated as the difference between value of output \& value of intermediate consumption.

Value Added $=$ Value of Output - Intermediate Consumption

Example of Concept of Value Added

Suppose a baker needs only flour to produce bread. He purchases flour as inputs worth ₹ 500 from the miller and then by virtue of its productive activities, converts the flour into bread and sells the bread for ₹ 700 .
In the given example:

- Flour is an input (Intermediate goods) and its value of ₹ 500 is termed as value of 'Intermediate Consumption'.
- Bread is the Output and its value of ₹ 700 is termed as 'Value of Output'.
- Difference between the value of output and intermediate consumption is termed as 'Value Added'. It means, that the baker has added a value of ₹ 200 to the total flow of final goods and services in the economy.
- Value added by each producing enterprise is also known as the Gross Value Added at Market price (GVA ${ }_{\text {MP }}$ ). It means, value added by baker ( $\mathbf{\text { ® }}$ 200) can be termed either as Value added or GVA ${ }_{\text {MP }}$.
- Sum total of GVA ${ }_{\text {MP }}$ of all producing enterprises within the domestic territory of a country during one year is equal to GDP $_{\text {MP }}$ (Gross Domestic Product at Market Price), i.e. $\sum G V A_{\text {MP }}=G D P_{\text {MP }}$
Let us now understand 'Intermediate Consumption' and 'Value of Output' in detail.


Intermediate Consumption and Final Consumption

Intermediate Consumption refers to the expenditure incurred by a production unit on purchasing those goods and services from other production units, which are meant for resale or for using up completely (i.e. further production) during the same year. In the given example, expenditure on flour is intermediate consumption.
Final Consumption refers to the expenditure on goods and services meant for final consumption and investment. In the given example, expenditure on bread is final consumption.

As discussed in the Chapter 2, intermediate goods include all those inputs, whose value is merged with the value of final goods. For example, flour is an intermediate good as its value is merged in the value of bread. However, any machinery purchased for making bread is not an intermediate good as its value will not be included in the value of intermediate consumption.

Imports are not Separately Included 

If the value of intermediate consumption is given, then imports are not included separately as imports are already included in the value of intermediate consumption. When 'Purchase of Raw Material' is given, it generally means that it includes purchases within the domestic territory and purchases from abroad (i.e. imports). However, if domestic purchases are specifically mentioned, then imports will also be included.
Let us understand this through following cases:
Calculate Intermediate Consumption in the following cases:
Case 1: (i) Intermediate Consumption $=\mathfrak{7} 1,200$; (ii) Imports $=\mathfrak{7} 300$
Ans. Intermediate Consumption $=\mathfrak{7} 1,200$
As imports are already included in the value of intermediate consumption.
Case 2: (i) Purchase of raw material from domestic firm $=\mathfrak{7} 500$; (ii) Imports $=\mathfrak{7} 100$
Ans. Intermediate Consumption $=\mathfrak{7} 500+\mathfrak{7} 100=\mathfrak{7} 600$
Imports are included as it is specifically mentioned that purchase of raw material is from domestic firm.
Case 3: (i) Purchase of raw material $=\mathfrak{7} 1,000$; (ii) Imports $=\mathfrak{7} 200$
Ans. Intermediate Consumption $=\mathfrak{7} 1,000$
Imports are not included as total purchase of raw material is given.
Case 4: (i) Purchase of raw material $=\mathfrak{7} 700$; (ii) Imports $=\mathfrak{7} 1,500$
Ans. Intermediate Consumption $=\mathfrak{7} 700+\mathfrak{7} 1,500=\mathfrak{7} 2,200$
In this particular case, we cannot assume that imports of $\mathfrak{7} 1,500$ to be included in purchases of $\mathfrak{7} 700$. So, we will consider both separately.

Value of Output

Value of output refers to market value of all goods and services produced during a period of one year.

How to Measure the Value of Output?

(i) When the entire output is sold in an accounting year, then:

Value of Output $=$ Sales + Production for Self-Consumption**
**All the goods produced are not necessarily sold in the market. A part of them is kept by the producer for his own use and consumption. Imputed value of such goods is included in Value of Output.
(ii) When the entire output is not sold in an accounting year, then the unsold stock is also added. Unsold stock is the excess of closing stock over opening stock and is termed as 'Change in Stock'. It means,

Value of Output $=$ Sales + Change in Stock + Production for Self-Consumption
Where, Change in stock = Closing stock - Opening stock
One More way to Calculate Value of Output
It can also be calculated as: Value of Output $=($ Quantity $\times$ Price $)+$ Change in Stock

For example, if a firm manufactures 1,000 pairs of shoes annually and sells them @ $\$ 500$ Per pair (assuming change in stock is nil), then: Value of Output $=1,000 \times 500=\$ 5,00,000$

Exports are not Separately Included 

Like imports, exports are also not separately included in value of output if 'Sales' are given (and domestic sales are not specifically mentioned). In case of an open economy, sales include both domestic sales and exports. Let us understand this:

Calculate Value of Output:

Case 1: (i) Sales $=\$ 2,000$; (ii) Exports $=\$ 400$
Ans. Value of Output $=\$ 2,000$
As exports are already included in the value of sales.
Case 2: (i) Domestic Sales = ₹ 700; (ii) Exports = ₹ 200
Ans. Value of Output $=\$ 700+\$ 200=\$ 900$
Exports are included as domestic sales are specifically mentioned.
Before we proceed with the steps needed to estimate the national income, let us first group the various production units into distinct industrial groups or sectors. It is done because it is easier to estimate national income of a group of similar production units as compared to estimating each production unit separately.

Industrial Classification of Producing Enterprises

All the production units of the economic territory are grouped into three broad groups:

1. Primary Sector: It includes production units exploiting natural resources like land, water, subsoll assets, etc. For example, farming, fishing, mining, animal husbandry, forestry, etc. It is primary as it is the source of basic raw materials for the secondary sector.
2. Secondary Sector: It includes production units which are engaged in transforming one good into another good. Such an activity is called manufacturing activity. These units convert raw materials into finished goods. For example, firms engaged in converting sugarcane into sugar, construction companies, power generation, etc. It is called secondary because it depends on primary sector for raw materials.
3. Tertiary Sector: It includes production units engaged in producing services. For example, transport, education, finance, government administration, etc. This sector finds third place because its growth primarily depends on primary and secondary sectors.

Steps of Value Added Method

The main steps for estimating national income by Value Added Method are:

Step 1: Identify and classify the production units

The first step is to identify and classify all the producing enterprises of an economy into primary, secondary and tertiary sectors.

Step 2: Estimate Gross Domestic Product at Market Price

In the second step, Gross Value Added at Market Price (GVA ${ }_{\mathrm{MP}}$ ) of each sector is calculated and sum total of GVA ${ }_{\mathrm{MP}}$ of all sectors give GDP $_{\mathrm{MP}}$, i.e. $\sum G V A_{\mathrm{MP}}=G D P_{\mathrm{MP}}$.

Step 3: Calculate Domestic Income (NDP ${ }_{F C}$ )
By subtracting the amount of depreciation and net indirect taxes from GDP $_{\text {MP }}$, we get domestic income, i.e. $N D P_{F C}=G D P_{M P}-$ Deprecation - Net Indirect Taxes.
Step 4: Estimate net factor income from abroad (NFIA) to arrive at National Income
In the final step, NFIA is added to domestic income to arrive at National Income.

National Income $\left(N N P_{F C}\right)=N D P_{F C}+N F I A$

Precautions of Value Added Method

The various precautions to be taken in Value Added Method are:

1. Intermediate Goods are not to be included in the national income: since such goods are already included in the value of final goods. If they are included again, it will lead to double

VALUE ADDED METHOD

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
counting.
2. Sale and Purchase of second-hand goods are not included: as they were included in the year in which they were produced and do not add to current flow of goods and services. However, any commission or brokerage on sale or purchase of such goods will be included in the national income as it is a productive service.
3. Production of Services for self-consumption (Domestic Services) are not included: Domestic services like services of a housewife, kitchen gardening, etc. are not included in the national income since it is difficult to measure their market value. These services are produced and consumed at home and never enter the market place and are termed as non-market transactions.

It must be noted that paid services, like services of maids, drivers, private tutors, etc. should be included in the national income.
4. Production of Goods for self-consumption will be included: in the national income as they contribute to the current output. Their value is to be estimated or imputed as they are not sold in the market.
5. Imputed value of owner-occupied houses should be included: People, who live in their own houses, do not pay any rent. But, they enjoy housing services similar to those people who stay in rented houses. Therefore, value of such housing services is estimated according to market rent of similar accommodation. Such an estimated rent is known as imputed rent.
6. Change in *Stock of Goods (Inventory) will be included: Net increase in the stock of inventories will be included in the national income as it is a part of capital formation.
*Stock or Inventory is unsold goods, unused raw material or semi-finished goods which a firm carries from one year to the next.
7. Sale and purchase of shares, bonds and debentures (new and old): will not be included as such transactions do not contribute to current flow of goods and services. These financial assets

4.6 

are mere paper claims and involve a change of title only. However, any commission or
brokerage on such financial assets is included as it is a productive service.

Production for Self-consumption

- Goods Produced for self-consumption are included in National Income: All the final goods produced within the country are not necessarily sold in the market. A part of them is kept by the production the country. For example, farmers keep a major part of their produce for self-consumption. Imputed value of such goods is included in national income.
- Services Produced for self-consumption are not included in National Income: Services like housewife working in her own house, doctor treating his own child or teacher teaching his own child will not be included in national income as it is difficult to ascertain their market value and such services are not rendered for the purpose of earning income.


Problem of Double Counting

In measuring the National Income, the value of only final goods and services is to be included. However, the problem of double counting arises when value of intermediate goods is also included along with value of final goods. Double counting refers to counting of an output more than once while passing through various stages of production.
A commodity passes through various stages of production before reaching the final stage. When value of the commodity is taken at each stage, it is likely to include the cost of inputs more than once. This leads to double counting.
Let us understand this through the famous example of Farmer, Miller and Baker.

- Farmer: Suppose, farmer produces 50 kg of wheat and sells it for ₹ 500 to miller (flour mill). For farmer, wheat of ₹ 500 is a final product. (If intermediate cost for farmer to be zero, then his value added will be ₹ 500).
- Miller: For miller, wheat is an intermediate good. Miller converts wheat into flour and sells it for ₹ 700 to a baker. Now, flour of ₹ 700 is a final product for the Miller. (Value added by miller $=700-500=\$ 200$ )
- Baker: For baker, flour is an intermediate good. Baker manufactures bread from flour and sells the entire bread to final consumers for ₹ 1,000 . Bread of ₹ 1,000 is a final product for the baker. (Value added by baker $=1,000-700=\$ 300$ )
Let us present the data in a chart
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

In the given example, wheat is a final product for farmer, flour for miller and bread for baker. As a general practice, every producer treats his commodity as the final output. It means: Total value of output $=500+700+1,000=\$ 2,200$.
However, a careful examination reveals that each transaction contains the value of intermediate goods.

- The value of wheat is included in the value of flour.
- The value of flour is included in the value of bread.

As a result, the values of wheat and flour are counted more than once. This causes the problem of double counting. It leads to over estimation of value of goods and services produced. In order to know the correct value of national income, we must avoid this problem of double counting.

How to Avoid Double Counting? 

There are two alternative ways of avoiding double counting:
(i) Final Output Method: According to this method, value of only final goods should be added to determine the national income. In the given example, value of bread of $\$ 1,000$ sold to final consumers should be taken in the national income.
(ii) Value Added Method: According to this method, sum total of the value added by each producing unit should be taken in the national income. In the given example, value added by farmer ( $\mathbf{\$ 5 0 0}$ ), miller ( $\mathbf{\$ 2 0 0}$ ) and baker ( $\mathbf{\$ 3 0 0}$ ), i.e. total of $\$ 1,000$ should be included in the National Income.

Sum of Value Added = Sum of Factor Incomes

- Production means addition of value to the inputs through combined efforts of various factors of production (land, labour, capital and enterprise). It means, value added (or $\mathrm{NVA}_{\mathrm{FC}}$ ) is nothing but the contribution made by different factors in the production process.
- So, every individual factor has a right to get back a share for the value added to the inputs.
- The producer distributes this NVA ${ }_{F C}$ among the owners of factors of production as rent, wages, interest and profit.
So, it is rightly said that Sum of Value Added = Sum of Factor Incomes. (Refer solved example 24 and unsolved practicals 21 and 22)


4.3 INCOME METHOD

Income Method measures national income from the perspective of factor incomes. Under this method, incomes received by all the residents of a country for their productive services during a year are added up to obtain the national income. According to this method, all the incomes that accrue to the factors of production by way of wages, profits, rent, interest, etc. are summed up to obtain the national income.

Income method is also known as 'Distributive Share Method' or 'Factor Payment Method'.

Components of Factor Income

The sum total of all the factor incomes earned within the domestic territory of a country is known as 'Domestic Income (NDP ${ }_{\text {FC }}$ )'. System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993 (joint publication of United Nations and World Bank) has elaborated the following components of Income Method:

1. Compensation of Employees (COE): COE refers to the sum total of remuneration paid to employees by employers for rendering productive services in the form of cash/kind/social security contributions. It includes all the payments and benefits, which the employees receive, directly or indirectly, from the employer. Compensation of Employees consists of 3 elements:
(i) Wages and salaries in cash: It includes all monetary benefits, like wages, salaries, bonus, dearness allowances, commission, etc.
Any reimbursement of business expenses incurred by the employees will be excluded from COE as such expenses are part of intermediate consumption of business enterprises.
(ii) Wages and salaries in kind: It includes all non-monetary benefits, like rent free home, free car, free medical and educational facilities, etc. An imputed value of these benefits should be included in national income.
However, it does not include any facility which is necessary for work and in which employees do not have any discretion. For example, uniforms to be worn during work only or vehicles to be used for work only. Such payments are intermediate consumption of business enterprises.
(iii) Employers' contribution to social security schemes: It includes contributions made by employer for the social security of employees. For example, contribution to provident fund, gratuity, labour welfare funds, etc. The aim of such contributions is to ensure safety and security of life of the employees.
Any contribution by third party (say, an insurance company) to an employee is not the part of COE as the insurance company is not the employer of injured worker. Any contribution by employees is also not included as such payments are made by the employees from COE only.
2. Rent and Royalty: Rent is a factor income earned by the owners for lending their services such as land, buildings, etc. Rental income includes both actual rent (rent of let out land) as well as imputed rent (rent of self-occupied properties). Imputed rent of owner occupied houses is calculated on the basis of market rental value of the house.
Royalty is the income earned by a person/institution for lending intellectual property rights and rights of subsoil assets. For example, owners of mineral deposits like coal, iron ore, natural gas, etc. can earn income by giving mining rights to the contractors.
3. Interest: Interest refers to amount received for lending funds to a production unit. It includes both actual interest as well as imputed interest of funds provided by the entrepreneur. 'Interest income' includes interest on loans taken for productive services only. For example, interest paid by a firm (private or government) to households or interest paid by bank to the individuals will be included in the interest income as it contributes to the production of goods and services. However, interest paid by households is not included as the loan is taken to meet consumption expenditure.
Interest income does not include:
(i) Interest paid by government on public debt and interest paid by consumers as such interest is paid on loans taken for consumption purposes.
(ii) Interest paid by one firm to another firm.

4. Profit: Profit is the reward to the entrepreneur for his contribution to the production of goods and services. It is the residual income, which an entrepreneur earns after paying all the other factors of production.
The profit earned by an enterprise is used for 3 purposes:
(i) Corporate Tax: It is the direct tax paid by an enterprise to the government on the total profit earned by it. It is also known as Profit tax or Business tax.
(ii) Dividend: It refers to that part of profit, which is paid to the shareholders in the ratio of their shareholding. It is also known as distributed profits.
(iii) Retained Earnings: It refers to that part of profit, which is kept as reserve to meet unexpected contingencies or for business expansion. It is also known as Undistributed Profits or Savings of Private Sector or Reserves and Surplus.
In short, Profit = Corporate Tax + Dividend + Retained Earnings

Operating Surplus 

Operating surplus is another term used in factor payments. It refers to sum total of income from ownership of physical/financial or intellectual property (rent + royalty + interest) and income from entrepreneurship (profit). It is also known as non-wage income.
Operating surplus arises in both private and government enterprises. However, it does not arise in the general government sector as it works with the motive of social welfare. Its basic aim is to operate for the benefit of public. For example, the services of law and order are available for free of cost to the people. So, incomes like rent, interest and profit are nil in general government sector. Operating surplus does not arise in the subsistence sector also as the production is meant only for self-consumption and there is no marketable surplus.
5. Mixed Income: It is the income generated by own-account workers (like farmers, barbers, etc.) and unincorporated enterprises (like retail traders, small shopkeepers, etc.). It is the income of people who own and operate a business enterprise using their own factor services (land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship). It is the term used for any income that has elements of more than one type of factor income. Mixed income arises from the productive services of self-employed persons, whose income includes wages, rent, interest and profit and these elements cannot be separated from each other. For example, the income of a doctor running a clinic at his residence.

Reason for Concept of Mixed Income

- In certain situations, accounts of most production units are not available to the estimators of National Income. Moreover, due to different accounting practices, it is not possible for the estimators to clearly identify the components of different factor incomes.

- So, when total factor payments can be estimated, but cannot be segregated into separate heads (COE, Rent and Royalty, Interest and Profits), then an additional factor payment, known as 'Mixed Income' is added.
- This factor payment is also known as 'Mixed Income of Self-Employed' as this problem arises mainly in case of self-employed people like doctors, chartered accountants, consultants, etc.


COMPONENTS OF DOMESTIC INCOME (NDP ${ }_{10}$ ) 

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

Steps of Income Method

The various steps involved in estimating national income by Income Method are:
Step 1: Identify and classify the production units.
All the producing enterprises employing various factors of production are identified and classified into primary, secondary and tertiary sectors.
Step 2: Estimate the factor income paid by each sector.
The factor incomes paid by each sector are classified under the following heads: (i) Compensation of employees; (ii) Rent and Royalty; (iii) Interest; (iv) Profit; and (v) Mixed Income.

Step 3: Calculate Domestic Income (NDP ${ }_{10}$ ).

When factor incomes of all the sectors are summed up, we get domestic income (NDP ${ }_{10}$ ). In short, NDP $P_{10}=$ Compensation of Employees + Rent and Royalty + Interest + Profit + Mixed Income

Step 4: Estimate net factor income from abroad (NFIA) to arrive at National Income. In the final step, NFIA is added to domestic income to arrive at National Income (NNP ${ }_{10}$ ), i.e. $N N P_{10}=N D P_{10}+$ Net factor income from abroad.

Precautions of Income Method 

Following precautions are to be considered while estimating national income by Income Method:

1. Transfer Incomes: (like scholarships, donations, charity, old age pensions, etc.) are not included in the National income because such receipts are not connected with any productive activity and there is no value addition.
2. Income from sale of second-hand goods will not be included: in national income as their original sale has already been counted. If they are included again, it would lead to double counting. However, any brokerage or commission received by brokers or commission agents on sale of such goods will be included as it is an income received for rendering productive service.
3. Income from sale of shares, bonds and debentures will not be included: as such transactions do not contribute to current flow of goods and services. These financial assets are mere paper claims and involve a change of title only.
However, any commission or brokerage on such financial assets is included as it is a productive service.

Always Avoid Capital Gains

Capital gains refer to income from sale of second-hand goods (say, old car) and financial assets (bonds, debentures, etc.). Any income arising from such transactions is not a factor income as these transactions are not productive transactions and do not add to the current flow of goods and services in the economy.
4. Windfall gains: (like income from lotteries, horse race, etc.) are not included as there is no productive activity connected with them.
5. Imputed value of services provided by owners of production units will be included: Imputed value of owner-occupied houses, interest on own capital, production for selfconsumption, etc. will be included as these are productive activities and add to the flow of goods and services.
6. Payments out of past savings: (like death duties, gift tax, interest tax, etc.) are not included in the National income because they are paid out of wealth or past savings and do not add to current flow of goods and services.

4.4 EXPENDITURE METHOD

Factor income earned by factors of production is spent in the form of expenditure on purchase of goods and services produced by firms.

- This method measures national income as sum total of final expenditures incurred by households, business firms, government and foreigners.
- This total final expenditure is equal to gross domestic product at market price, $\sum$ Final Expenditure $=\boldsymbol{G D P}_{\text {MP }}$
- This method is also known as 'Income Disposal Method' or 'Consumption and Investment Method'.


Components of Final Expenditure

Expenditure is undertaken by all the sectors of an economy: Households, Government, Firms and the Foreign Sector.

The various components of final expenditure are:
![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

1. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE): It refers to expenditure incurred by households and private non-profit institutions serving households on all types of consumer goods, i.e. durable (except houses**), semi-durable, non-durable goods and services.

- PFCE = Household Final Consumption Expenditure + Private Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households Final Consumption Expenditure
- PFCE includes expenditures incurred by normal residents, whether in the domestic territory or abroad. So, any expenditure incurred by residents during their foreign tour/travel will be added in PFCE. However, any expenditure incurred by non-residents and foreign visitors in the domestic market will be deducted from PFCE.
**Note: The expenditure incurred on purchase or construction of owner-occupied houses is treated as capital formation (included under Gross Residential Construction Investment) and not as durable consumption. Other costly consumer durables, like cars, air conditioners, washing machines, etc. are included under PFCE.
![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

2. Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE): It refers to the expenditure incurred by general government on various administrative services like defence, lave and order, education etc. Government produces goods and services with the aim of social welfare without any intention of earning profits.

Estimation of Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE) 

GFCE is equal to cost of goods and services produced by government for collective use by the public. These services are valued at their cost to the government as they are not normally sold to the public. It means, GFCE is calculated as:
Government Final Consumption Expenditure $=$ Intermediate Consumption of government +COE paid by government + Direct purchases from abroad for embassies and consulates located abroad - Sale of goods and services produced by general government.
3. Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF) or Gross Investment: It refers to the addition to capital stock of the economy. It represents the expenditure incurred on acquiring goods for investment by the production units located within the domestic territory. There are two components of GDCF:
(i) Gross Fixed Capital Formation: It refers to the expenditure incurred on purchase of fixed assets. This expenditure is generally divided into three sub-categories:
(a) Gross Business Fixed Investment: It includes expenditure on the purchase of new plants, machinery, equipments, etc.
(b) Gross Residential Construction Investment: It includes expenditure on purchase or construction of new houses by the households.
(c) Gross Public Investment: It includes expenditure on construction of flyovers, roads, bridges etc. by the government.
It must be noted that 'Net Purchases of Fixed Assets (both new and old) from Abroad' is a part of Fixed Capital Formation as it adds to the existing stock of capital in the domestic economy.
(ii) Inventory Investment (Change in Stock or Change in Inventory): It refers to the physical change in the stock of raw material, semi-finished goods and finished goods lying with the producers. It is included as an investment item because it represents the goods produced but not used for current consumption. It is calculated as the difference between the closing stock and the opening stock of the year.
'Inventory' is a stock concept as it is related to a point of time, while 'Change in Inventory' is a flow concept as it is measured over a period of time.

Fixed Investment Vs Inventory Investment: Fixed investment refers to addition to stock of fixed assets in the hands of producers during an accounting year. On the other hand, inventory investment is addition to the stock of inventory with the producers during an accounting year.
It means,
GDCF = Gross Fixed Capital Formation + Inventory Investment; or
GDCF = Gross Business Fixed Investment + Gross Residential Construction Investment + Gross Public Investment + Inventory Investment.

It is important to understand that purchase of shares and debentures, either old or new, is not included in investment. For example, if I have purchased 500 shares of Reliance Industries, it may be an investment from my point of view, but for economy, it is simply a transfer of purchasing power and not an investment.

GROSS DOMESTIC CAPITAL FORMATION 

(OR GROSS INVESTMENT)

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

Some Important Points about GDCF

- Any increase in stock of consumer goods with households is excluded from inventory investment as it is assumed that such goods are consumed, the moment they are purchased.
- Purchase of shares and debentures (either old or new) is not included in GDCF as it is simply a transfer of purchasing power and there is no addition to flow of goods and services.
- Purchase of second hand goods (like old house or old machinery) is also not included in GDCF as such goods have already been included in the year of original purchase.

4. Net Exports ( $X$ - M): It refers to the difference between exports and imports of a country during a period of one year.

- Exports (X) refer to expenditure by foreigners on purchase of domestic products. The exported goods have been produced within the country's domestic territory. So, they are included in output of an economy.
- Imports (M) are the expenditure by residents on foreign products. Imports are deducted to obtain domestic product as they are not produced within the domestic territory.
- Instead of treating exports and imports separately, the difference between the two is taken and is termed as Net Exports.
Calculate Net Exports in the following cases:
Case 1: (i) Exports $=\mathbb{5 0 0}$; (ii) Imports $=\mathbb{7 3 0 0}$
Ans. Net Exports $=\mathbb{5 0 0}-\mathbb{7} 300=\mathbb{2 0 0}$
Case 2: (i) Exports $=\mathbb{6 0 0}$; (ii) Imports $=\mathbb{7 7 0 0}$
Ans. Net Exports $=\mathbb{6 0 0}-\mathbb{7 7 0 0}=-\mathbb{1 0 0}$
Case 3: (i) Exports $=0$; (ii) Imports $=\mathbb{2 0 0}$
Ans. Net Exports $=0-\mathbb{2 0 0}=-\mathbb{2 0 0}$
Case 4: (i) Net Exports $=\mathbb{7 5 0 0}$; (ii) Imports $=\mathbb{2 0 0}$
Ans. Net Exports $=\mathbb{5 0 0}$
(As Net Exports are given, we will ignore imports)
Case 5: (i) Net Imports or Excess of Imports over Exports $=\mathbb{2 0 0}$
Ans. Net Exports $=-\mathbb{2 0 0}$
(As Net imports is positive, it means that Exports are less than imports)
Case 6: (i) Net Imports $=-\mathbb{3 5 0}$
Ans. Net Exports $=\mathbb{3 5 0}$
(As Net imports is negative, it means that Exports are more than imports)

Comparison between Net Exports and Net Factor Income from Abroad

| Basis | Net Exports | Net Factor Income from Abroad |

Steps of Expenditure Method 

The steps involved in calculating National Income by Expenditure Method are:

Step 1: Identify the Economic Units incurring Final Expenditure

All the economic units, which incur final expenditure within the domestic territory, are classified under 4 groups: (i) Household sector; (ii) Government sector; (iii) Producing sector; (iv) Rest of the world sector.

Step 2: Classification of Final Expenditure

Final expenditures incurred by the above mentioned economic units are estimated and classified under the following heads:

- Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE)
- Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE)
- Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF)
- Net Exports (X-M).

The sum total of four components of final expenditure gives Gross Domestic Product at Market Price $\left(\mathrm{GDP}_{\mathrm{MP}}\right)$, i.e. $G D P_{M P}=P F C E+G F C E+G D C F+(X-M)$

Step 3: Calculate Domestic Income ( $N D P_{F C}$ )

By subtracting the amount of depreciation and net indirect taxes from GDP $_{\text {MP }}$, we get domestic income, i.e. $N D P_{F C}=G D P_{M P}-$ Depreciation - Net Indirect Taxes.

Step 4: Estimate net factor income from abroad (NFIA) to arrive at National Income

In the final step, NFIA is added to domestic income to arrive at National Income.
National Income $\left(N N P_{F C}\right)=N D P_{F C}+N F I A$

Precautions of Expenditure Method

The various precautions to be taken while using the Expenditure Method are:

1. Expenditure on Intermediate Goods will not be included in the national income: as it is already included in the value of final expenditure. If it is included again, it will lead to double counting of expenditures.

2. Transfer Payments are not included: as such payments are not connected with any productive activity and there is no value addition.
3. Purchase of second-hand goods will not be included: as such expenditure has already been included when they were originally purchased. Such goods do not affect the current flow of goods and services. However, any commission or brokerage on such goods is included as it is a payment made for productive service.
4. Purchase of financial assets: (shares, debentures, bonds etc.) will not be included as such transactions do not contribute to current flow of goods and services. These financial assets are mere paper claims and involve a change of title only.
However, any commission or brokerage on such financial assets is included as it is a productive service.
5. Expenditure on own account production: (like production for self-consumption, imputed value of owner occupied houses, free services from general government and private nonprofit institutions serving households) will be included in the national income since these are productive services.

4.5 RECONCILIATION OF THREE METHODS 

Since all three methods are used to measure the value of the same physical output, they will provide the same National Income. The following chart shows the reconciliation of three methods used for calculating National Income.

Domestic Income Vs National Income 

It is possible that an income, which is a part of domestic income of India, is not included in the national income. Similarly, an income, which is a part of national income, may not be included in the domestic income. It happens because national income includes the income of normal residents only (irrespective of their place of earning), whereas, domestic income includes the income of both residents and nonresidents (but, within the domestic territory of the country). Let us clear this point with the help of some examples:

Included in National Income, but not in Domestic Income

1. Salary received by an Indian employee working in the Japanese Embassy in India.

It will be included in the national income as he is a resident of India. However, such an income will not be included in India's domestic income as the Japanese Embassy is not a part of the domestic territory of India.
2. Profits of a branch of State Bank of India (SBI) in England.

It will be included in the national income as it is a part of the factor income from abroad. However, it will not be included in India's domestic income as the SBI branch in England is not a part of the domestic territory of India.

Included in Domestic Income, but not in National Income

1. Rent received by a company in India, which is owned by a non-resident.

It will be included in the domestic income as the rent is received within the domestic territory of India. However, it will not be included in the national income as it is a part of the factor income paid abroad.
2. Profits earned by a branch of a foreign bank in India.

It will be included in the domestic income as these profits are earned within the domestic territory of India. However, it will not be included in the national income as it is a part of the factor income paid abroad (Foreign Bank is not a resident of India).

4.8 NATIONAL INCOME AT CURRENT PRICE AND CONSTANT PRICE 

National Income at Current Price

It is the money value of final goods and services produced by normal residents of a country in a year, measured at the prices of the current year. For example, measurement of India's National Income of 2024-25 at the prices of 2024-25.

- It is also known as 'Nominal National Income'.
- It does not show the true picture of economic growth of a country as any increase in nominal national income may be due to rise in price level without any change in physical output.

So, in order to eliminate the effect of price changes, national income is also estimated at a constant price.

National Income at Constant Price

It is the money value of final goods and services produced by normal residents of a country in a year, measured at base year price. Base Year is a normal year which is free from price fluctuations. Presently, 2011-12 is taken as the base year in India.
If we measure India's National Income of 2024-25 at the prices of 2011-12, then it is termed as 'National Income at constant price'.

- It is also known as 'Real National Income'.
- It shows the true picture of economic growth of a country as any increase in real national income is due to increase in output only.


Why do we measure National Income at the prices of the Base Year?

The need for estimating national income at constant price arises because national income at current price may give a misleading picture of economic performance if the prices are continuously rising or falling.
With high rate of inflation in India, nominal national income may create a false sense of economic growth.

Numerical Illustration

Let us understand this concept with the help of following hypothetical schedule:
Table 4.1: National Income at Current Price and National Income at Constant Price

| Commodity | Quantity <br> Produced <br> (2024-25) <br> $\mathbf{Q}_{1}$ | Current Year Price (\$) <br> (2024-25) <br> $\mathbf{P}_{1}$ | Base Year Price (\$) <br> (2011-12) <br> $\mathbf{P}_{1}$ | Market Value at Current Price (\$) $\mathbf{Q}_{1} \times \mathbf{P}_{1}$ | Market Value at Base Year Price (\$) $\mathbf{Q}_{1} \times \mathbf{P}_{1}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Wheat (Kg) | 1,000 | $20 / \mathrm{kg}$. | $12 / \mathrm{kg}$. | 20,000 | 12,000 |
| Cloth (Metres) | 500 | 25 / metre | 15 / metre | 12,500 | 7,500 |
| Milk (Litres) | 250 | 40 / litre | 30 / litre | 10,000 | 7,500 |
| Total Market Value | 42,500 | 27,000 |  |  |  |

As seen in Table 4.1, National Income of 2024-25 at Current year prices is ₹ 42,500 and at base year prices is ₹ 27,000 for the same level of output. The difference of ₹ 15,500 is not real. It does not give a true picture of economic growth as the increase is merely due to rise in prices.
So, real growth of an economy can be measured only through National Income at constant prices.

Conversion of National Income at Current Price into Constant Price 

This can be done by eliminating the effects of price change on national income with the help of a suitable 'Price Index'. Price Index is an index number which shows the change in price level between two different time periods. It indicates whether a rise or a fall in the national income from one year to another is real or not.
It is done with the help of the following formula:

$$
\text { National Income at Constant Price }=\frac{\text { National Income at Current Price }}{\text { Current Price Index }} \times 100
$$

For example, if price index for the current year is 150 and national income at current price is $\mathbb{Z} 1,50,000$ crores, then the national income at constant price will be:

$$
\text { National Income at Constant Price }=\frac{1,50,000}{150} \times 100=\mathbb{Z} 1,00,000 \text { crores }
$$

National Income at Current Price Vs National Income at Constant Price

| Basis | National Income at Current Price | National Income at Constant Price |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Meaning | It refers to money value of final goods and <br> services produced by normal residents of <br> a country in a year, measured at current <br> year prices. | It refers to money value of final goods and <br> services produced by normal residents of <br> a country in a year, measured at prices of <br> base year. |

| Calculation | Current Price (P) $\times$ Current Quantity (Q) | Base Year Price (P) $\times$ Current Quantity (Q) |
| Alternative name | It is also known as Nominal National Income. | It is also known as Real National Income. |

4.9 NOMINAL GDP AND REAL GDP

1. Nominal GDP or GDP at Current Price: When GDP of a given year is estimated on the basis of price of the same year, it is called nominal GDP.
2. Real GDP or GDP at Constant Price: When GDP of a given year is estimated on the basis of price of Base Year, it is called real GDP.

| Real GDP is more than <br> Nominal GDP | Real GDP is equal to <br> Nominal GDP | Real GDP is less than <br> Nominal GDP |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Price level in base year is more <br> than price level in current year. | Price level in both the years is same. | Price level in base year is less than price <br> level in current year. |

Which is better: Nominal GDP or Real GDP?

Real GDP is better as compared to Nominal GDP because of following reasons:

1. Real GDP helps in determining the effect of increased production of goods and services as it is affected only by change in physical output. On the other hand, Nominal GDP can increase even without any increase in physical output as it is affected by change in prices also.

2. Real GDP is a better measure to make periodic comparison in the physical output of goods and services over different years.
3. Real GDP facilitates international comparison of economic performance across the countries. Therefore, Real GDP is better than Nominal GDP as it truly reflects the growth of an Economy.
As per the Ministry of Statistics \& Programme Implementation (MoSPI), Real GDP or GDP at Constans (2011-12) Prices in the year 2023-24 is estimated to attain a level of ₹ 173.82 lakh crore as against ₹ 160.71 lakh crore in 2022-23, showing a growth rate of $8.2 \%$. Nominal GDP or GDP at Current Prices in the year 2023-24 is estimated to attain a level of ₹ 295.36 lakh crore, as against ₹ 269.50 lakh crore in 2022-23, showing a growth rate of $9.6 \%$.

Determination of Nominal GDP and Real GDP 

Nominal GDP and Real GDP can be determined in the following manner:

$$
\text { Real GDP }=\frac{\text { Nominal GDP }}{\text { Price Index }} \times 100
$$

Or, Nominal GDP $=\frac{\text { Real GDP } \times \text { Price Index }}{100}$
Example for Better Understanding: Estimate the value of Nominal Gross Domestic Product for a hypothetical economy, the value of Real Gross Domestic Product and Price Index are given as ₹ 500 crores and 125 respectively.
(CBSE, Sample Paper 2021-22 (Term-2))

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Real GDP } & =\frac{\text { Nominal GDP }}{\text { Price Index }} \times 100 \\
500 & =\frac{\text { Nominal GDP }}{125} \times 100 \\
\text { Nominal GDP } & =\frac{500 \times 125}{100}=₹ 625 \text { crores }
\end{aligned}
$$

GDP Deflator (or Price Index)

As we have seen, Nominal GDP is affected by both changes in price and physical output. On the other hand, Real GDP is affected by change in physical output only. To eliminate the effect of price changes and to determine the real change in physical output, we can use 'GDP Deflator'. GDP Deflator measures the average level of prices of all the goods and services that make up GDP. It is the ratio of Nominal GDP to Real GDP of current year.

$$
\text { GDP Deflator (or Price Index) }=\frac{\text { Nominal GDP }}{\text { Real GDP }} \times 100
$$

For example, if nominal GDP is ₹ 15,000 crores and real GDP is ₹ 12,000 crores, then:

$$
\text { GDP Deflator }=\frac{15,000}{12,000} \times 100=125
$$

GDP Deflator of 125 shows that the general price level has increased by $25 \%$.
Note: It must be noted that GDP Deflator indicates change in price level related to all goods and services produced within the domestic territory of a country.

In the given example, we can also convert nominal GDP into real GDP through GDP Deflator:

$$
\text { Real GDP }=\frac{\text { Nominal GDP }}{\text { GDP Deflator }} \times 100=\frac{15,000}{125} \times 100=\$ 12,000 \text { crores }
$$

Like GDP Deflator, we can also estimate GNP Deflator as follows:

$$
\text { GNP Deflator }=\frac{\text { Nominal GNP }}{\text { Real GNP }} \times 100
$$

GDP and Welfare 

GDP is often considered as an index of welfare of the people. Welfare means a sense of material well-being among the people. Welfare is generally measured in terms of availability of goods and services per person. An increase in the Real GDP means increase in the physical output in the economy, i.e. greater per head availability of goods and services, which means higher level of welfare of people. So, higher GDP is generally taken as greater welfare of people.
However, this generalization may not be correct due to following limitations or reasons:

1. Distribution of GDP: It is possible that with rise in GDP, inequalities in the distribution of income may also increase, i.e. the gap between rich and poor increases (i.e. rich become more rich and poor become more poor). So, if with rise in GDP, inequality increases, then welfare of the people may not rise as much as the rise in GDP.
2. Change in prices: If increase in GDP is due to rise in prices and not due to increase in physical output, then it will not be a reliable index of economic welfare.
3. Non-monetary exchanges: Many activities in an economy are not evaluated in monetary terms. For example, non-market transactions like services of housewife, kitchen gardening, leisure time activities, etc. are not included in GDP, due to non availability of data. However, such activities influence the economic welfare.
4. Externalities: Externalities refer to benefits or harms of an activity caused by a firm or an individual, for which they are not paid or penalised. Activities which result in benefits to others are termed as positive externalities and activities which result in harm to others are termed as negative externalities.

- Example and Impact of Negative Externality: Environmental Pollution caused by industrial plants. Such pollution reduces welfare through negative effect on health.
- Example and Impact of Positive Externality: Use of public parks by the people for pleasure for which no payments are made by the public. This increases welfare through positive effect on health.
Such external effects do not form part of market transactions. GDP does not take into account externalities, positive or negative.

5. Rate of population growth: GDP does not consider the changes in the population of a country. If rate of population growth is higher than the rate of growth of GDP, then it will decrease the per capita availability of goods and services, which will adversely affect the economic welfare.
6. Composition of GDP: Higher GDP will promote welfare only if increased output comprises of goods of mass consumption and essential goods. Increase in production of war goods does not lead to any direct increase in the welfare of people. So, composition of GDP also affects welfare.

Finally, it can be concluded that GDP may not be taken as a satisfactory measure of economic welfare due to above mentioned limitations, yet it does reflect some index of economic welfare.
In this context, some economists and policy planners have suggested the concept of 'Green GNP'. Green GNP measures national income or output adjusted for the depletion of natural resources and degradation of the environment. It will help to attain a sustainable use of natural environment and equitable distribution of benefits of developments. A larger number signifies greater sustainability.

Before we proceed to Solved Practicals, let us first have a brief discussion on 'How to Measure Depreciation' under different situations.

How to Measure Depreciation? 

As discussed in the $2^{\text {nd }}$ Chapter, the concept of Depreciation is very important to differentiate between Gross value and the Net value. 'Gross' is inclusive of depreciation, whereas, 'net' excludes it. Gross Value $=$ Net Value + Depreciation.
Students must be very careful while dealing with Depreciation. Let us now understand calculation of depreciation in the following cases:
Calculate Depreciation in the following cases:
Case 1: (i) $\mathrm{GDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathbb{\$ 5 , 0 0 0 ;}$ (ii) $\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathbb{\$ 4 , 7 0 0 ;}$ (iii) Net Factor Income from Abroad $=\mathbb{\$ 1 0 0 .}$
Ans. In the given case, we will first calculate $\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$ by adding Net Factor Income from Abroad in GDP $_{\mathrm{FC}}$ and then we will subtract $\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$ from it to arrive at Depreciation. It means,
Step 1. GNP $_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathrm{GDP}_{\mathrm{FC}}+$ Net Factor Income from Abroad $=\mathbb{\$ 5 , 0 0 0}+\mathbb{\$ 1 0 0}=\mathbb{\$ 5 , 1 0 0}$
Step 2. Depreciation $=\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}-\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathbb{\$ 5 , 1 0 0}-\mathbb{\$ 4 , 7 0 0}=\mathbb{\$ 4 0 0}$.
Case 2: (i) GDP $_{\mathrm{MP}}=\mathbb{\$ 6 , 0 0 0 ;}$ (ii) $\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathbb{\$ 4 , 0 0 0 ;}$ (iii) Net Factor Income from Abroad $=$ $\mathbb{\$ 2 0 0 ;}$ (iv) Net Indirect Tax $=\mathbb{\$ 3 0 0}$.
Ans. In the given case, we will first calculate GNP $_{\mathrm{FC}}$ by adding Net Factor Income from Abroad and subtracting Net Indirect Tax in GDP $_{\text {MP }}$ and then we will subtract $\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}$ from it to arrive at Depreciation. It means,
Step 1. GNP $_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathrm{GDP}_{\mathrm{MP}}+$ Net Factor Income from Abroad - Net Indirect Tax

$$
=\mathbb{\$ 6 , 0 0 0}+\mathbb{\$ 2 0 0}-\mathbb{\$ 3 0 0}=\mathbb{\$ 5 , 9 0 0}
$$

Step 2. Depreciation $=\mathrm{GNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}-\mathrm{NNP}_{\mathrm{FC}}=\mathbb{\$ 5 , 9 0 0}-\mathbb{\$ 4 , 0 0 0}=\mathbb{\$ 1 , 9 0 0}$.
Case 3: (i) Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) = 3,700; (ii) Net Domestic Capital Formation (NDCF) $=\mathbb{\$ 3 , 6 5 0 ;}$ (iii) Change in Stock $=\mathbb{\$ 3 0 0}$.
Ans. In the given case, we will first calculate Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF) by adding Change in Stock in GFCF and then we will subtract Net Domestic Capital Formation (NDCF) from it to arrive at Depreciation. It means,
Step 1. GDCF = GFCF + Change in Stock $=\mathbb{\$ 3 , 7 0 0}+\mathbb{\$ 3 0 0}=\mathbb{\$ 4 , 0 0 0}$
Step 2. Depreciation $=$ GDCF - NDCF $=\mathbb{\$ 4 , 0 0 0}-\mathbb{\$ 3 , 6 5 0}=\mathbb{\$ 3 5 0}$.
Case 4: (i) Gross Investment $=\mathbb{\$ 5 , 3 0 0 ;}$ (ii) Net Investment $=\mathbb{\$ 3 , 8 0 0 ;}$ (iii) Opening Stock $\mathbb{\$}$ $\mathbb{\$ 5 0 0 ;}$ (iv) Closing Stock $=\mathbb{\$ 7 0 0}$.
Ans. In the given case, Net Investment will be subtracted from Gross Investment to arrive at Depreciation. It means,
Depreciation $=$ Gross Investment - Net Investment $=\mathbb{\$ 5 , 3 0 0}-\mathbb{\$ 3 , 8 0 0}=\mathbb{\$ 1 , 5 0 0}$.

Case 5: (i) Capital value of Asset or Fixed Capital Goods or Durable Producer Goods $=\mathbb{1}, 000$ crores; (ii) Estimated life of the Capital Asset $=20$ Years; (iii) Scrap Value $=$ Nil.
(C BSE, Sample Paper 2020 (Modified))

Ans. In the given case, capital value of asset is given along with its estimated life span and scrap value.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Depreciation on Capital Asset } & =\frac{\text { Capital Value of Asset }- \text { Scrap Value }}{\text { Estimated life of the Capital Asset }} \\
\text { Depreciation } & =\frac{1,000-0}{20}=\$ 50 \text { crores }
\end{aligned}
$$
