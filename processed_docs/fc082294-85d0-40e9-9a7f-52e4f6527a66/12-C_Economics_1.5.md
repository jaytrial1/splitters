CHAPTER 

Money

5.1 INTRODUCTION

Money is the most important discovery of modern times. It is the foundation stone around which all the economic activities revolve. It is very difficult to imagine the modern economic life without money. It is the basic necessity of all economies.

For, "Various stages of Evolution of Money", refer Power Booster Section.

5.2 BARTER SYSTEM

Before money was invented, the primitive world's trade was carried out according to the barter system of exchange.

Meaning of Barter Exchange

In the beginning of civilization, human needs were simple and limited. People used to exchange goods with each other to satisfy their wants. Barter Exchange refers to exchange of goods for goods. An economy, where there is a direct barter of goods and services, is called a 'Barter Economy' or 'C-C Economy' (where C stands for commodity).
For example, when a farmer gives wheat and gets cloth from the weaver in return, it is known as barter exchange.

Barter System can work when there exists 'Double Coincidence of Wants'

Double Coincidence of Wants refers to the simultaneous fulfillment of mutual wants of buyers and sellers. In the above example, want for clothing by the farmer coincides with the want of weaver for wheat. However, it is very difficult to find double coincidence of wants in real life. It leads to huge trading costs.
With rise in economic activities, the exchange through barter became more difficult and complicated. Let us discuss the various limitations of Barter Exchange.

Limitations of Barter Exchange 

The major limitations of Barter Exchange are:

1. Lack of Double Coincidence of Wants: Barter system can work only when both $b_{0}$ and seller are ready to exchange each other's goods. For example, A can exchange $g_{0}$ with B only when A has what B wants and B has what A wants. However, such $d_{0}$ coincide coincidence is very rare.
2. Lack of Common Measure of Value: In the barter system, all commodities are not of equal value and there is no common measure (unit) of value of goods and services, in which exchange ratios can be expressed. For example, if A has wheat and B has rice, then it is difficult to decide, how much wheat is needed to exchange with one kilogram of rice. In the absence of common measure, the exchange ratio is fixed randomly, in which one of the party generally suffers.
Barter system can work with few commodities in the primitive society. However, it is very difficult in the modern economy, where we need millions of exchange ratios for a large number of goods and services.
3. Lack of Standard of Deferred Payment: Under barter system, contracts involving future payments or credit transactions cannot take place with ease because of following reasons:
(a) The borrower may not be able to arrange goods of exactly same quality at the time of repayment.
(b) There may be conflicts regarding which specific commodity is to be used for repayment.
(c) The commodity, to be repaid, may lose or gain its value at the time of repayment. So, it is very difficult to make deferred payments in the form of goods.
4. Lack of Store of Value: Under barter system, it is difficult for people to store wealth for future use because:
(a) Most of the goods (like wheat, rice, vegetables, etc.) do not possess durability, i.e. their quality deteriorates with passage of time.
(b) Storage of goods requires time and efforts.

As a result, goods cannot be used to store the earnings for a long period.
With so many difficulties, barter exchange could not continue for a long time. As a result, ${ }^{1}$ was replaced by monetary exchange, i.e. buying and selling of goods with the help of 'Money

Money has been defined differently by different economists. The most acceptable definition of money can be stated in terms of all the functions of money. So, let us first discuss the main functions of money.

5.3 FUNCTIONS OF MONEY

The functions of money can be broadly categorised under two heads:

1. Primary Functions (Main or Basic Functions)
2. Secondary Functions (Subsidiary or Derivative Functions)

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Primary Functions 

Primary functions include the most important functions of money, which it must perform in every country. These are:

(i) Medium of Exchange

Money, as a medium of exchange, means that it can be used to make payments for all transactions of goods and services. It is the most essential function of money. Money has the quality of general acceptability. So, all exchanges take place in terms of money.

- This function has removed the major difficulty of lack of double coincidence of wants and inconveniences associated with the barter system.
- Use of money allows purchase and sale to be conducted independently of one another.
- This function of money facilitates trade and helps in conducting transactions in an economy.
- Money has no power to satisfy human wants, but it commands power to purchase those things, which have utility to satisfy human wants.
For, "How does money separate the acts of sale and purchase", refer HOTS.


(ii) Measure of Value (Unit of Value)

Money as a measure of value means that money works as a common denomination, in which values of all goods and services are expressed.

- By reducing the value of all goods and services to a single unit (i.e. price), it becomes very easy to find out the exchange ratios between them and comparing their prices.
- This function facilitates maintenance of business accounts, which would be otherwise impossible.
- Money helps in calculating relative prices of goods and services. Due to this reason, it is regarded as a 'Unit of Account'. For instance, 'Rupee ( $\boldsymbol{\ell}$ ' is the unit of account in India, 'Pound ( $\boldsymbol{C}$ ' in England and so on.


Secondary Functions

These refer to those functions of money which are supplementary to the primary functions. These functions are derived from primary functions and, therefore, they are also known as 'Derivative Functions'.

The major secondary functions are:

(i) Standard of Deferred Payments 

Money as a standard of deferred payments means that money acts as a 'standard' for payments, tohics are to be made in future. Every day, millions of transactions take place in which payments are not made immediately. Money encourages such transactions and helps in capital formation and economic development of the economy.
This function of money is significant because:

- Money as a standard of deferred payments has simplified the borrowing and lending operations.
- It has led to the creation of financial institutions.


(ii) Store of Value (Asset Function of Money)

Money as a store of value means that money can be used to transfer purchasing power from present to future. Money is a way to store wealth. Although wealth can be stored in other forms also, but money is the most economical and convenient way. It provides security to individuals to meet contingencies, unpredictable emergencies and to pay future debts. Under barter system, it was difficult to use goods as a store of wealth due to perishable nature of some goods and high cost of storage.
Money as store of value has the following advantages:

- Money is available in fractional denomination, ranging from ₹ 1 to ₹ 500.
- Money is easily portable. So, it is easy and economical to store money as its storage does not require much space.
- Money has the merit of general acceptability. So, it can be easily exchanged for goods at all times.
- Savings in terms of money are much more secure than in terms of goods.


One More Secondary Function of Money

Money also perform the function of 'Transfer of Value'. By 'transfer of value', we mean transferring the value of durable and immovable goods from one place to another. Through money, anybody can sell his immovable property at any particular place and buy a property at some other place. This function provides mobility to machinery, land and goods.

For "Contingent, Static and Dynamic Functions of Money", refer Power Booster.

Money has overcome the drawbacks of Barter System

Barter system makes the exchange process very difficult and highly inefficient. Money has overcome the drawbacks of barter system in the following manner:

1. Medium of Exchange: As a medium of exchange, money has removed the major difficulty of lack of double coincidence of wants in barter system. It separates the acts of sale and purchase of goods and services and helps both the parties to obtain maximum satisfaction. A buyer can buy goods through money and a seller can sell goods for money.

2. Measure of value: Under Barter system, different goods were of different values and there was no common denomination to express their exchange ratios. But, money is the measuring rod which expresses the value of other commodities. It becomes easier to compare the relative values of any two commodities.
3. Store of value: Under Barter system, it is very difficult to store goods for future use. Most of the goods are perishable and their storage requires huge space and transportation cost. But, money can be easily stored for future use. It is the most convenient and economical means of storing earnings and wealth. It has the merit of general acceptability and its value remains stable as compared to other goods.
4. Standard of deferred payments: Barter system lacks suitable standard of deferred payments which creates difficulty in credit transactions. Borrower may not be able to arrange goods of exactly the same quality at the time of repayment. On the other hand, due to general acceptability of money, future payments are expressed in terms of money. Money has simplified the borrowing and lending operations and encouraged capital formation.

Money is demanded for three motives: (a) Transaction Motive; (b) Precautionary Motive; and (c) Speculative Motive. For a detailed discussion, refer Power Booster.

5.4 DEFINITION OF MONEY 

After studying the primary and secondary functions of money, we can give a comprehensive definition of money.
Money is anything which is generally accepted as a medium of exchange, measure of value, store of value and means for standard of deferred payment.

- The term 'money' is used to cover all such things like coins, currency notes, cheques etc., which are used to conduct business transactions and settlement of business claims.
- It must be noted that 'Money' can be any commodity chosen by common consent, as an instrument of exchange of goods and services.

Refer Power Booster for: (i) Functional Definition of Money; (ii) Definition on the Basis of Liquidity; and (iii) Definition on the Basis of Scope.

Legal Definition of Money

According to this definition, money is what the law says is money. So, anything which the government declares as money is money. On the basis of legal recognition, money is of two kinds:
(i) Legal Tender Money: Money which can be legally used to make payment of debts or other obligations is termed as legal tender money. A creditor is obliged by law to receive such money in payment of debt due to him. Legal tender money is of two kinds:
(a) Limited Legal Tender: It refers to that form of legal tender money, which can be paid in discharge of a debt up to a certain limit. Beyond this limit, a person may refuse to accept the payment and no legal action can be taken against him. In India, coins are limited legal tender. For example, as per Coinage Act, 2011, coins shall be a legal tender in case of coin of any denomination not lower than one rupee, for any sum not exceeding ₹ 1,000 .

The major secondary functions are:
(i) Standard of Deferred Payments

Money as a standard of deferred payments means that money acts as a 'standard' for payments, tithich are to be made in future. Every day, millions of transactions and helps in capital formation not made immediately. Money encourages such transactions and economic development of the economy.
This function of money is significant because:

- Money as a standard of deferred payments has simplified the borrowing and lending operations.

According to this definition, money is what the law says is money. So, anything which the government declares as money is money. On the basis of legal recognition, money is of two kinds:
(i) Legal Tender Money: Money which can be legally used to make payment of debts or other obligations is termed as legal tender money. A creditor is obliged by law to receive such money in payment of debt due to him. Legal tender money is of two kinds:

(b) Unlimited Legal Tender: It refers to that form of legal tender money, which can be made in discharge of a debt of any amount. Legal action can be taken against a person who refuses to accept this money. In India, paper notes are unlimited legal tender, (ii) Non-Legal Tender Money or Optional Money: It refers to that form of money, which generally accepted, but legally, one is not bound to accept it. For example, cheques, bank draft bills of exchange, etc. do not have legal backing and their acceptance is totally optional.

CONCEPT OF LEGAL TENDER MONEY 

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
'Cryptocurrency, crypto-currency or crypto is a digital or virtual currency which uses cryptography to secure transactions. It works as a medium of exchange through a computer network and does not rely on any central authority, such as government or bank, to verify transactions. In India, it has not been accorded the status of legal tender.

Bank Money

Bank money refers to demand deposits created by the commercial banks. These deposits are repayable by the banks on demand. The depositors are given cheque facility to withdraw money from their account or to make payments. It must be noted that bank money is a Non-Legal Tender Money or Optional Money.

5.5 MONEY SUPPLY

Money Supply refers to total volume of money held by public at a particular point of time in an economy.

Features of Money Supply

1. It includes 'Money held by Public only'. The term 'public' signifies the money-using sector. i.e. individuals and business firms. It does not include Money-Creating Sector (or Producers Suppliers of Money), i.e. Government and Banking System as cash balances held by them do not come into actual circulation in the country.
2. It is a 'Stock Concept', i.e. it is concerned with a particular point of time.

Components of Money Supply 

The two main components of money supply are:

1. Currency with Public: It consists of paper notes and coins held by the public. It is the most liquid of all assets and includes coins of denominations of $\mathbb{2} 20, \mathbb{\$ 1 0}, \mathbb{\$ 5 ,} \mathbb{\$ 2 ,} \mathbb{\$ 1 ,}$ etc. and paper notes of denominations like $₹ 500, \mathbb{2} 200, \mathbb{1} 100$, etc.

- Currency Money is also termed as 'Fiat Money'. Fiat Money is defined as the money which is under the fiat or order from the government to act as money, i.e. under law, it must be accepted for all debts.
- It is also termed as 'Legal Tender Money' as it can be legally used to make payment of debts or other obligations.

Does this $\$ 500$ Note has Paper worth $\$ 500$ ? $\square$ No, its Intrinsic Value (i.e. cost of printing is $\$ 2.29$ approx.). However, it has legal value of $\$ 500$. So, it is called Fiat Money.
2. Demand Deposits with Banks: It refers to demand deposits (or Bank Money) of the public with the commercial banks. Demand deposits are the deposits, which can be encashed by issuing cheques at any time by the account holders.

- A demand deposit is treated as equal to currency held as it is readily accepted as a means of payment.
- Only Net Demand Deposits are included: It must be noted that demand deposits are taken on net basis, i.e. inter-bank deposits are excluded. Inter-bank deposits are the deposits held by banks on behalf of other banks. Such deposits do not form a part of the money supply, as they do not belong to the public.
Gross Demand Deposits include inter-bank deposits (or inter-banking claims), while Net demand deposits do not include it. It must be noted that only Net Demand Deposits are taken as part of Money Supply.
- Term Deposits are not included: While calculating $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ measurement of money supply, only demand deposits are considered as a part of money supply and not the Term Deposits. \{Demand Deposits = Saving Account Deposits + Current Account Deposits\}
These two components of money supply are also known as 'Transaction Money' as they can be directly used for carrying out transactions at will.


Measures of Money Supply

Till 1967-68, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) used only the narrow measure of money supply. But, since 1977, four alternative measures of money supply ( $\mathrm{M}_{1}, \mathrm{M}_{2}, \mathrm{M}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{M}_{4}$ ) have been evolved:
(i) $M_{1}$ : It is the first and basic measure of money supply. $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ is the most liquid measure of money supply as all its components are easily used as a medium of exchange.
$M_{1}=$ Currency \& Coins with Public + Demand Deposits of Commercial Banks + *Other Deposits with RBI

[^0]
[^0]:    *Other deposits with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) include deposits held by the RBI on behalf of foreign banks and governments, public financial institutions, World Bank, IMF, etc. However, it does not include deposits of the Indian Government and commercial banks with RBI. It constitutes a very small proportion of $\mathrm{M}_{1}$. So, it does not have any significant role to play in the monetary policy formulation.

(ii) $\mathbf{M}_{2}$ : It is a broader concept of money supply as compared to $\mathrm{M}_{1}$. In addition to $\mathrm{M}_{1}$, it also includes savings deposits with post office saving bank.
$M_{2}=M_{1}+{ }^{* *}$ Savings Deposits with Post Office Saving Bank
**Savings deposits with Post Office Saving Bank' is not withdrawable by cheque. So, they could not be placed under demand deposits with bank. As a result, the concept of $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ was evolved.
(iii) $\mathbf{M}_{3}$ : This concept is broader as compared to $\mathrm{M}_{1}$. In addition to $\mathrm{M}_{1}$, it also includes net time deposits.
$M_{3}=M_{1}+$ Net Time Deposits with Banks
(iv) $\mathbf{M}_{4}$ : This measure includes total deposits with post office saving bank in addition to $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ $M_{4}=M_{3}+$ Total Deposits with Post Office Saving Bank (Excluding NSC)
(NSC is National Saving Certificate)

Important Facts about Money Supply

- The four measures of money supply represent different degrees of liquidity, with $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ being the most liquid and $\mathrm{M}_{4}$ being the least liquid.
- $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ is widely used as a measure of money supply and it is also known as 'aggregate monetary resources of the society'.
- $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ are generally known as narrow money supply concepts, whereas, $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{M}_{4}$ are known as broad money supply concepts.
- Reserve Bank of India (RBI) releases data on money supply in India.


Example of Money Supply

Calculate $\mathrm{M}_{1}, \mathrm{M}_{2}, \mathrm{M}_{3}$, and $\mathrm{M}_{4}$ :
(i) Currency with public
( $\boldsymbol{\ell}$ in crores)
(ii) Demand deposits with banks
84,000
(iii) Other deposits with RBI
(iv) Total deposits with Post office
(iv) Net time deposits with banks
(v) Savings deposits with post office saving bank
$68,000$
3,612
22,500
2,00,555
5,528

(Cont...)

Solution: 

$M_{1}=$ Currency with public + Demand deposits with banks + Other deposits with RBI
$M_{1}=84,000+68,000+3,612=\$ 1,55,612$ crores
$M_{2}=M_{1}+$ Savings deposits with post office saving bank
$M_{2}=1,55,612+5,528=\$ 1,61,140$ crores
$M_{3}=M_{1}+$ Net time deposits with banks
$M_{3}=1,55,612+2,00,555=\$ 3,56,167$ crores
$M_{4}=M_{3}+$ Total deposits with Post office
$M_{5}=3,56,167+22,500=\$ 3,78,667$ crores

What is High Powered Money (H)?

High Powered Money is money produced by the RBI and the government. It consists of two things: (i) Currency held by the public; and (ii) Cash reserves with the banks.

'Money (M)'Vs 'High Powered Money (H)'

- 'Money' consists of currency and demand deposits, while 'High Powered Money' consists of currency and cash reserves with banks. It means, 'Currency held by the public' is common in both of them. The only difference is that 'Money' includes demand deposits of banks, while 'High Powered Money' includes cash reserves with the banks.
- 'H' is high-powered as compared to ' $M$ ' because cash reserves (part of H ) serve as the actual base for the generation of demand deposits.

REVISION OF KEY POINTS

- Barter Exchange refers to exchange of goods for goods.
- Limitations of Barter Exchange: (i) Lack of double coincidence of wants; (ii) Lack of common measure of value; (iii) Lack of standard of deferred payments; (iv) Lack of store of value.
- Primary Functions of Money:
(i) Medium of Exchange: Money, as a medium of exchange, means that it can be used to make payments for all transactions of goods and services.
(ii) Measure of Value: Money as a measure of value means that money works as a common denomination, in which values of all goods and services are expressed.
- Secondary Functions of Money:
(i) Store of Value: Money as a store of value means that money can be used to transfer purchasing power from present to future.
(ii) Standard of Deferred Payments: Money as a standard of deferred payments means that money acts as a 'standard' for payments, which are to be made in future.

POWER: BIOGISTEIR 

1. EVOLUTION OF MONEY

Money has evolved through different stages according to the time, place and circumstances, it developed through the following stages:
(i) Commodity Money: In the earliest period of human civilization, any commodity that was generally demanded and chosen by common consent, was used as money. Goods like furs, skins, salt, rice, wheat, utensils, weapons etc. were commonly used as money. Such exchange of goods for goods was known as 'Barter Exchange'.
(ii) Metallic Money: With progress of human civilisation, commodity money changed into metallic money. Metals like gold, silver, copper, etc were used as they could be easily handled and their quantity can be easily ascertained. It was the main form of money throughout the major portion of recorded history.
(iii) Paper Money: It was found inconvenient as well as dangerous to carry gold and silver coins from place to place. So, invention of paper money marked a very important stage in the development of money. Paper money is regulated and controlled by Central bank of the country (RBI in India). At present, a very large part of money consists mainly of currency notes or paper money issued by the central bank.
(iv) Credit Money: Emergence of credit money took place almost side by side with that of paper money. People keep a part of their cash as deposits with banks, which they can withdraw at their convenience through cheques. The cheque (known as credit money or bank money), itself, is not money, but it performs the same functions as money.
(v) Plastic Money: The latest type of money is plastic money in the form of Credit cards and Debit cards. They aim at removing the need for carrying cash to make transactions.

2. CONTINGENT FUNCTIONS OF MONEY

The various contingent functions of money are:
(i) Distribution of National Income: Money helps in optimum distribution of national income among different factors of production (land, labour, capital and enterprise). Total outp ut of the country is jointly produced by these factors. So, the output should be distributed among them. Money helps in distribution of the national product in the form of rent, wage, interest and profit, which are expressed in money terms.
(ii) Maximisation of Satisfaction: Money helps the consumers and producers in maximizing their satisfaction. A consumer derives maximum satisfaction by equating the price (expressed in terms of money) of each commodity with its marginal utility (satisfaction). Similarly, a producer maximises his satisfaction (profit) by equating the marginal productivity of a factor with price of such factor.
(iii) Basis of Credit Creation: Credit creation by commercial banks was not possible until money was introduced. Money as a store of value has encouraged savings by people in the form of demand deposits in banks. Such demand deposits are used by the commercial banks to create credit.

(iv) Productivity of Capital: Money increases the productivity of capital as it is the most liquid asset and can be put to any use. Due to liquidity of money, capital can be easily transferred from less productive uses to more productive uses.
(v) Bearer of options: Money provides purchasing power in the hands of the person (bearer) holding it and he has numerous options for its use. The bearer can change his decision regarding use of money from time-to-time and place-to-place depending upon urgency, intensity and his priority.
(vi) Guarantee of Solvency: Money serves as a guarantee of solvency for an individual or institution. If an individual has enough money (more than his liabilities), then he cannot be declared insolvent or bankrupt. Due to this reason, individuals and firms keep large amount of money to meet unexpected needs.

3. STATIC AND DYNAMIC FUNCTIONS OF MONEY 

According to Paul Einzig, functions of money can be classified under two heads:
(i) Static Functions: They refer to those functions which facilitate the working of the economy of a country. For example, the functions of money, as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, a store of value and a standard of deferred payments, are all static functions because without these functions, the economy of a country cannot work.
(ii) Dynamic Functions: They refer to those functions which cause movement in the level of economic activity in a country. So, dynamic functions determine the economic trends. For example, function of money as the basis of credit and liquidity actually brings about changes in the level of economic activity in a country. Expansion of credit not only leads to a rise in the price level, but also increases the levels of income, output and employment in the economy.
Both, Static and Dynamic functions are needed for healthy functioning of an economy.

4. DEMAND FOR MONEY

People demand commodities such as rice, wheat, clothes, etc. because these goods possess utility. However, money does not possess any utility to directly satisfy the consumers. Then, why do people demand money?
Broadly stating, there are three main motives, for which money is wanted by the people:
(a) Transaction Motive; (b) Precautionary Motive; (c) Speculative Motive.
(a) Transaction Motive: It refers to demand for money for conducting day-to-day transactions. This motive can be looked at from the perspective of consumers, who want income to meet their household expenditure (income motive) and from the perspective of businessmen, who require money to carry on their business activities (business motive). The transaction motive relates to demand for money to meet the current transactions of individuals and business units.
The income, which a person gets, is not continuous whereas, expenditure is continuous. So, to bridge the gap between receipt of income and its expenditure, people hold cash. According to Keynes, transaction demand for money is positively associated with the level of income, i.e. higher the level of income, larger would be the size of money holdings for transactions.
(b) Precautionary Motive: It refers to the desire of people to hold cash balances for unforeseen contingencies. People wish to hold some money to provide for the risk of unforeseen events like sickness, accident, etc. The amount of money held under this motive, depends on the nature of individual and on the conditions in which he lives. The demand of

money for precautionary balances is also closely related to the level of income. Higlier the level of income, more will be the cash balances for contingencies.

Transaction Motive Vs Precautionary Motive 

1. In case of transaction motive, money is held for ordinary transactions, while under precautionary motive, cash is kept to meet unforeseen transactions.
2. Under transaction motive, holding of money is very convenient and value of money, in terms of other goods, is relatively certain. However, under precautionary motive, holding of money depends on the degree of uncertainty, i.e. more money is kept in the events of war or financial crisis and less money during normal conditions.
In general, the cash balances held for transaction and precautionary motives are directly dependent on the level of income.
(c) Speculative Motive: It refers to desire of the holder to keep cash balance as an alternative to financial assets like bonds. Under speculative motive, it is presumed that people can hold their wealth either in the form of bonds or in the form of cash balances. The decisions regarding holding of bonds or cash balances depend upon the expectations about changes in the rate of interest or capital value of assets (bonds) in future.
The interest rate varies inversely with the market value of securities (bonds), i.e. when interest rate rises, market value of bonds falls. Hence, demand for money for speculative motive becomes less at high interest rates and becomes large at low interest rates.

5. DEFINITIONS OF MONEY

Over a period of time, different definitions of money have evolved. Let us discuss the definitions of money under the following heads:
(A) Legal Definition of Money
(C) Definition on the Basis of Liquidity
(B) Functional Definition of Money
(D) Definition on the Basis of Scope

(A) Legal Definition of Money

It has already been discussed in detail in the chapter.

(B) Functional Definition of Money

According to this definition, money refers to anything that performs the four basic functions of money: (a) Medium of exchange; (b) Measure of value; (c) Standard of deferred payments; (d) Store of value. In the words of Crowther, "Money may be defined as anything which is generally acceptable as a medium of exchange and at the same time acts as a measure and store of value".

(C) Definition on the Basis of Liquidity

On the basis of liquidity, money can be classified as:
(i) Money or Liquid form of Money: Money has the quality of general acceptability which makes it the most liquid asset. By liquidity, we mean the speed and certainty with which an asset can be converted back into money. Coins, currency notes and bank money are the most liquid form of money.
(ii) Near Money: It includes those financial assets, which are not as liquid as coins and currency notes, but can be easily converted into money for paying debts. For example, National saving deposits, fixed deposit receipts, Treasury Bills, bonds, etc. They are as

good as money, but are non-legal tender money. Near money cannot be used directly for purchase of goods and services. But, it can be converted into cash within a short span of time.

(D) Definition on the Basis of Scope 

According to the scope of money, it has been defined in two ways:
(i) Narrow Definition of Money: It includes only those things which function as money. It includes currency notes, coins and demand deposits of banks as they perform the following functions of money: (a) Medium of exchange, (b) Measure of value, (c) Standard of deferred payments, (d) Store of value.
(ii) Broad Definition of Money: In addition to narrow money, it also includes time deposits in banks and post offices. Time deposits are included as they have high degree of moneyness and can be converted into chequeable deposits within a short span of time. Broad Definition of Money $=$ Money Assets + Near Money.

6. CLASSIFICATION OF MONEY

Money can be classified on the basis of relationship between the value of money as money and the value of money as a commodity. Broadly, money can be classified as: (I) Full-bodied money; (II) Representative Full-bodied money; (III) Credit money.

(I) Full-bodied Money

Any unit of money, whose face value and intrinsic value are equal, is known as Full-bodied money, i.e. Money Value $=$ Commodity Value. For example, during the British period, one rupee coin was made of silver and its value as money was same as its value as a commodity.
Face Value Vs Intrinsic Value: Every unit of money has two values:
(a) Face Value: It refers to the value which is written on the unit of money. For example, face value of ten rupee note is equal to ten rupees.
(b) Intrinsic Value: It refers to the value of the metal contained in the unit of money. For example, the value of silver contained in a silver coin is known as its intrinsic value.

(II) Representative Full-bodied Money

It refers to money which is usually made of paper. The value of representative full-bodied money is much higher than its value as a commodity. It is accepted as money as it can be conveniently used for carrying out transactions. Such a type of paper money is $100 \%$ backed by metallic reserve of gold or silver and is redeemable at the option of the holder. For example, in case of convertible paper receipts, a person can exchange the amount stipulated on the paper receipt for equal value of gold.

Two Kinds of Representative Money

- Convertible Paper Money: It refers to the currency notes which are freely convertible into full-bodied money (gold or silver) at any time at the option of the holder. However, 100\% backing of gold or silver is not desired as all the notes in circulation are not simultaneously presented for conversion.
- Inconvertible Paper Money: It is that kind of paper money which cannot be convertible into full-bodied money at the option of the holder. However, it circulates and commands value as its issue is regulated by a responsible government. This money does not have

any backing of standard coins or bullion. Indian one-rupee note is a good example of inconvertible paper money.

(III) Credit Money 

Credit money refers to the money whose intrinsic value (as a commodity) is much lower than its face value, i.e. Money Value > Commodity Value. For example, face value of $\mathbb{\$ 1 0 0}$ does $\mathbb{\$} 100$, but we would get a much lower value if we sell the note as a piece of paper. Credit cards bank deposits are other examples of credit money.
The various forms of credit money are:
(a) Token coins: These refer to small coins of various denominations, which are issued to facilitate day-to-day requirements of the people. All Indian coins, like those of $\mathbb{\$ 2 0}, \mathbb{\$ 1 0}, \mathbb{\$ 5}, \mathbb{\$ 2 0}$ $\mathbb{\$}$ are token coins since their value as money is more than value of metal contained in them.
(b) Representative Token money: It is $100 \%$ backed and is fully redeemable in some commodity such as gold or silver. It is generally in the form of paper and market value of what is actually offered is less than value printed on paper notes.
(c) Circulating promissory notes issued by central bank: These are currency notes issued by Reserve Bank in India. These include all currency notes of denominations like $\mathbb{\$ 5 0}$, $\mathbb{\$ 2 0 0}, \mathbb{\$ 1 0 0}$, etc. Each promissory note contains the words, "I promise to pay the beare the sum of $\mathbb{\$}$......", and is signed by the Governor of India. The commodity value of a promissory note is much less than its money value.
(d) Demand Deposits in bank: Deposits are claims of creditors (depositors) against bank. These deposits can be withdrawn from the bank or transferred from one person to another by issuing a cheque. Such deposits do not have backing in terms of any bullion (gold or silver). The commodity value of a cheque is much lower than its money value. Demand deposits are very convenient for making transactions of huge amounts as they remove the risk of carrying large amounts of cash.

7. MONETARY SYSTEM IN INDIA

India has witnessed various monetary standards in its monetary history. The present monetary system in India is managed and controlled by RBI and is known as Inconvertible Paper Currency Standard. In India, 'rupee' has been regarded as the standard currency and all transactions are made in terms of rupees.
The noteworthy points about monetary system in India are:

- In India, the monetary authority is 'Reserve Bank of India'.
- India follows the 'Paper Currency Standard' as currency followed in India is made up of paper.
- Coins are limited legal tender money and can be used for making small payments when paper notes are unlimited legal tender and can be used for making payments of any amount.
- RBI has the sole monopoly to issue currency notes of $\mathbb{\$}$ and above. Ministry of Finance issues the one rupee note and all the coins. However, the responsibility of putting all the currency notes and coins into circulation rests with the RBI.
- India follows the 'Minimum Reserve System' for note issue. Under this system, the central bank (RBI) is required to keep a minimum reserve of gold and foreign exchange work $\mathbb{\$} 200$ crores and, on this basis, RBI can issue any number of notes.
